      "                            Hillary Clinton has won the Democratic Party nomination. Now, two things are important. The first is that Clinton defeats Donald Trump in November. The second is that Clinton should aim to build a true coalition of centrist and progressive politics, uniting the two wings of the Democratic Party.   If she sticks with the Clinton tradition of \"triangulating\" with Republicans, she risks not governing at all; a Trump victory would be a real possibility. If the United States were a parliamentary system, Clinton and Bernie Sanders would not even be in the same party. Clinton would be a center or even center-right party in the European scene, perhaps an Angela Merkel leading the Christian Democrats. There is little that is truly progressive about her politics. Sanders would be leading the Social Democrats, representing the party of trade unions, progressive taxation and regulation of Wall Street.   It is not unusual for centrists and social democrats to govern together, especially when a major goal is to keep out right-wing and anti-immigrant populist parties. But let's have no doubt: This would be a coalition, not a unity of forces. The happy talk of \"unifying\" a single Democratic Party is an Americanism that I believe is reaching the end of its usefulness. By 2020, it is quite possible that we will actually have four major political parties: a social democratic left, a centrist party, a right-wing conservative party and a populist anti-immigrant party (represented by Trump followers).   What would a coalition mean?  It would mean not just a party platform with some happy talk of progressivism. Party platforms are what economists call \"cheap talk.\" They mean almost nothing. They have almost no effect on actual governing since America does not have party-led governance. It has an executive branch led by a president, and shifting coalitions in Congress that do not heed any party's platform.    A coalition would mean a sharing of Cabinet positions. This too is fraught with ambiguity. I don't mean that a President Clinton would designate a set of candidates that would check the boxes with various ethnic, social and political constituencies. I mean that certain key Cabinet positions would be allocated to Bernie Sanders and his faction (and perhaps a separate party four years from now).     From the perspectives of the social democratic wing, Clinton comes with heavy baggage, of which three are most important. The first is her long-standing romance with Wall Street. It was Bill Clinton's political maneuver in 1992 to form an alliance of the Democrats and Goldman Sachs (Bob Rubin) that has defined the modern Democratic Party. It is at the root of the financial excesses of the past 20 years. We know that Wall Street remains a major Clinton funder and a serial breaker of the laws.  The second is her long-standing romance with the military-industrial complex. This too goes back to the Clinton presidency, with the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998 and the bombing of Belgrade, Serbia,  in 1999. Since then, Hillary Clinton has been a strong supporter of the U.S. war in Iraq (2003), the U.S. military efforts in Libya (2011) and covert operations in Syria (from 2011 Clinton also has close links with Saudi Arabia, which has been a funder of the Clinton Foundation, and is the CIA's partner in the war in Syria. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party is distraught with Clinton's hard-line approach, which is even more militaristic (though less bigoted) than Trump's, as well as with her close ties with the Saudi regime.    The third is the twisted conflicts of interests that connect the Clinton Foundation and the U.S. government. Those of us who work in international economics have watched for years as elementary ethical boundaries are blurred or ignored. The email scandal is not a one-off proposition. It is a reflection of the Clintons' arrogance to think they can get away with chronic ethical lapses. So far they have. To end this conflict of interest, I would strongly urge the suspension of the Clinton Foundation during any Clinton presidency.  The foundation's functions could easily be taken up by CARE, Save the Children and other nongovernmental organizations.    What then would be a coalition that could bridge the centrist and progressive factions? Sanders and his team should have their say over the Treasury secretary and at least one of the four key foreign policy positions: national security adviser, secretary of state, secretary of defense and head of national intelligence. To leave all four of the hard-power positions to Clinton would be to invite catastrophe, an expansion of war in the Middle East, a new Cold War (or God forbid a hot one) with Russia over NATO expansion, and nearly unchecked covert operations by the CIA. It is true that such formal coalition politics are not normal for the United States. On paper we are a presidential system in the executive, and a geographically based, not party-based system in Congress. There is no overarching government as in parliamentary rule.   Still, we are not in normal times. Both parties' nominees have record-high disapproval ratings in part because the candidates represent only one ideological faction of their respective parties: Clinton, the centrists, and Trump, the anti-immigrant populists.  They are deeply distrusted, even loathed by some, in the other part of their parties, such as Ryan Republicans and Sanders Democrats.   As Sanders has rightly declared, defeating Trump is a national priority. I will certainly vote for Hillary Clinton. I would like to campaign for her as well but that would depend on the confidence that her administration would end its disastrous romance with Wall Street, end its relentless militarism and end the Clintons' chronic shirking of ethical standards and clarity. In the meantime, it's also not too soon to start building a true social democratic party for the future.       Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\n",
      "                             Donald Trump is escalating his condemnation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state, calling the email fallout worse than Watergate. \"This looks like Watergate on steroids, frankly,\" Trump said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Wednesday. Clinton has increasingly come under scrutiny for her use of a private email server during her tenure leading the State Department, a practice that has come under scrutiny from federal officials. Clinton finally turned over her email server to the Justice Department last week, after resisting suggestions that she should do so for months. Federal officials have yet to find that Clinton discussed any classified information through her private email, though officials have flagged some emails for further review. Clinton and her aides have repeatedly insisted that Clinton did not break any laws and never shared any classified information through her email. Bob Woodward, who with Carl Bernstein exposed the Watergate scandal, has not gone as far as Trump's comparison, but said Monday that \"in a way it reminds me of the Nixon tapes.\" The Watergate scandal led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon after he tried to cover up his administration's involvement in a break-in at the Democratic National Committee's office in the Watergate complex in Washington. The scandal even involved the Supreme Court, which forced Nixon to turn over White House audio recordings. In his wide-ranging interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Trump, who opposes same-sex marriage, also suggested that gay marriage is a settled issue after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right. \"Some people have hopes of passing amendments, but it's not going to happen. Congress can't pass simple things, let alone that. So anybody that's making that an issue is doing it for political reasons. The Supreme Court ruled on it,\" Trump said. He also said he has attended a gay wedding, that of Broadway theater owner Jordan Roth. And if securing the Republican nomination doesn't pan out for Trump, don't expect the brash billionaire to consider the No. 2 post. Trump suggested he wouldn't be interested in becoming vice president. \"I just don't think it would be good for them, I don't think it would be good for me. It's a great position, a very important position. I just think in that position, perhaps they could do something different than me. And that's not to minimalize the position,\" Trump said. \n",
      "                             A tough political attack is a terrible thing to waste, but that is what Donald Trump has squandered by launching vague, sweeping accusations against Hillary Clinton at precisely the moment when newly released emails raise valid, specific concerns about whether Clinton improperly mixed her public and private interests while serving as secretary of state.  It's not enough for Trump to dub her \"Crooked Hillary,\" which always gets a roar of approval from friendly crowds that have already decided to vote Republican. If Trump wants to persuade truly undecided voters to shun Clinton, he needs to familiarize the voting public with the particulars of what Clinton's emails suggest, and why they might show conflicts of interest.  According to dozens of recently released emails, top State Department aides were in dialogue with officials from the Clinton Foundation, despite Hillary Clinton's vow to keep her charitable work isolated from official decision making.  In one communication, Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band pushes State Department staffers, telling them it's \"important to take care of\" a favored applicant. In another message, Band asked former Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills to connect Gilbert Chagoury, a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and donor to the Clinton Foundation, to officials in the State Department. \"We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person re Lebanon,\" Band wrote. \"As you know he's a key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon. Very imp.\" That \"substance person\" was the US ambassador to Lebanon -- a connection promised by State Department officials, although the ambassador says no meeting took place.    It's not exactly smoking-gun proof of corruption; none of the emails are to or from Clinton herself. Chagoury never got the meeting he sought with the ambassador to Lebanon. And we don't know if the applicant mentioned got a job. But it's fair to ask whether Clinton violated a promise to keep a wall between her official work and the family foundation. Ideally, the Trump campaign would demand and/or lay out a detailed timeline showing when the emails were sent, and demand specific answers from Clinton about what happened and why.  But that's not likely to happen: Trump is too fond of broad accusations rather than specific proof. \"It's called pay for play,\" he said in a recent speech.  And some of these [emails] were really, really bad and illegal. If it's true, it's illegal. You're paying and you're getting things.\" Not exactly. As the Clinton campaign has countered: \"Neither of these emails involve the secretary or relate to the foundation's work. They are communications between her aides and the president's personal aide, and indeed the recommendation was for one of the secretary's former staffers who was not employed by the foundation.\" True, the campaign's denials don't answer the question completely: Trump has every right to ask whether Clinton's aides adhered to the letter and spirit of an agreement to keep foundation and government work entirely separate. If they didn't, she can and should be held accountable by voters. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. But by calling it illegal without solid proof, Trump risks blowing a political opportunity. During the Democratic primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders goofed by dismissing Clinton's possible ethics issues: \"the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails,\" Sanders famously said at the first Democratic debate.   That let Clinton off the hook, and prevented Sanders from raising the issue later in the campaign, when it might have done him some good. Trump is making a similar mistake.  It should be a respected legal supporter -- an ex-judge or law professor, for instance -- who points out any potential ethical shortcomings in actions of Clinton or her aides. And any criticism from Trump should be paired with a specific promise -- and, perhaps, a screening panel or mechanism -- to ensure a Trump White House would avoid such problems. It's not as much fun as blindly bashing \"Crooked Hillary,\" but it might hold more water and signal to voters that holding high officials accountable for their actions is serious business, not just an excuse for name-calling.  \n",
      "                             Vulnerable down-ballot Republican candidates seized on the news Friday that the FBI was reviewing new emails tied to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private server, arguing the GOP must remain in charge of Congress so they can keep check on a potential Clinton presidency.   \"This decision shows exactly why we need strong watchdogs in Congress to ensure thorough oversight of the executive branch,\" said veteran Republican Rep. Darrell Issa. The Southern California congressman, who has been one of President Barack Obama and Clinton's most spirited investigators over the years, is in an unexpectedly tough re-election battle.    If re-elected, Issa vowed he would \"ensure the FBI completes its investigation thoroughly and impartially this time around.\"  After months of struggling to defend a constant barrage of Donald Trump's controversial comments, GOP lawmakers in swing states turned the tables and blasted their Democratic opponents for their loyalty to Clinton who has admitted her use of a private server was wrong.  Clinton calls on FBI to release 'full and complete facts' of email review \"When will Catherine Cortez Masto stand up to Hillary Clinton's reckless behavior?\"  GOP Rep. Joe Heck asked about the Democrat he's running against for Nevada's open Senate seat in a press released titled \"Cortez Masto blindly supports Hillary Clinton because she always overlooks wrongdoing by Democrats.\"  Cortez Masto has not yet issued a statement in response. The National Republican Senatorial Committee blasted Deborah Ross, a North Carolina Democrat challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Richard Burr, for not breaking with Clinton. \"Less than 24-hours ago, Deborah Ross happily campaigned in Winston Salem with Hillary Clinton who was introduced as \"the next 'President.'  But as news breaks today that the FBI is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server, Deborah Ross is silent,\" the statement said. As of late Friday, Ross's campaign had not issued any statement about the development.  The bizarre day that blunted Clinton's good mood Aides and strategists said it was too early to gauge what the political fallout will be for down-ballot candidates of either party. But the issue of Clinton's honesty, especially in the wake of the email controversy, has been a rallying cry for Trump supporters and this added fuel may inspire undecided voters now to back Trump -- and others on the GOP ticket -- as the campaign draws to a close. The National Republican Congressional Committee issued a flurry of press releases calling out Democrats in competitive races to declare whether they support the Democratic nominee. In one of these, attacking first term Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Nebraska, spokeswoman Kate Martin said, \"the FBI is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton and Nebraska voters deserve to know if Brad Ashford still stands by her.\"  Martin added, \"It's time Ashford stood up for Nebraskans who deserve better than Hillary Clinton, who enables corruption, scandals and lies.\" Just as Trump did, at least one senator used the news Friday to raise money for his campaign.  \"If you agree that Hillary Clinton should be indicted for mishandling classified information, please stand with me today by making an urgent contribution today,\" said an appeal from Sen. Rand Paul. R-Kentucky, who is expected to be re-elected.  Biden on Weiner: 'I'm not a big fan' Democrats largely silent While Republicans were quick to react to the news, congressional Democrats were largely silent on the development, a reflection of how unclear the political damage might be. Some privately complained that the cryptic letter from FBI Director James Comey left them grasping for a response.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, was angry about that. She issued a sharply worded statement in which she said she was \"shocked\" when she read Comey's letter because it was so vague \"it's impossible to make any informed judgment on this development.\" \"One thing is clear: Director Comey's announcement played right into the political campaign of Donald Trump, who is already using the letter for political purposes. And all of this just 11 days before the election,\" Feinstein said. House Democrats believe they are in striking distance of taking back the chamber. Anxious to contain the politically treacherous situation, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, called on Comey to provide more details so voters will have a better understanding of the FBI's views. \"The public interest would be served by the FBI providing the facts, rather than allowing Republicans to stoke innuendo and falsehoods 11 days away from a presidential election,\" she said.  One Democratic strategist argued Democrats running for the House and Senate who have backed Clinton through the ups and downs the email controversy should stick with her now too.  \"We trust and support Hillary Clinton and we know that she would be a good president for us and for the country. That's what we've been saying throughout the conversation about emails in the last year or so,\" said Basil Smikle, a top official in the New York State Democratic Party, in an interview on CNN.  Following word that an FBI \"sexting\" investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-New York, who is the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, had led to the discovery of the new emails that could be pertinent to the Clinton probe, one GOP strategist quipped on Twitter that the partisan Weiner may have \"saved\" the Senate for Republicans. \"This won't save the WH campaign, but Carlos Danger may have saved the GOP Senate,\" said John Weaver, referring to an Internet name Weiner has used. \n",
      "                             A federal judge expressed dismay over the State Department's continued delays releasing Hillary Clinton's emails. \"The government has put me between a rock and a hard place,\" Judge Rudolph Contreras said at a hearing Tuesday, noting his displeasure over the State Department's explanations about the delays. Contreras said he felt he was being forced to choose between accepting the State Department's proposed timeline without question, or else risk the accidental release of sensitive information by hurrying the process. The State Department's proposed production schedule would result in all the remaining emails being released the day before \"Super Tuesday\" and after early contests in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. In the end, the judge ordered the State Department to provide detailed information about why the process is taking so long, and how the State Department temporarily lost track of thousands of pages of emails, leading to the current delay. He also told the State Department to be ready to produce some subset of emails by February 18, \"if not sooner,\" adding that he'd make that determination after reading their explanation. When an attorney for the State Department told Contreras it would take over a week for emails that have already completed the inter-agency review process to be posted online, Contreras said, \"that seems like an unreasonably long period of time.\" The State Department has released about 85% of Clinton's official emails to date, but many of the most sensitive emails -- those that require addition review by the intelligence community and other government agencies -- are expected to be in the remaining tranche. Five-hundred and seventy of the approximately 3,700 remaining documents have made it to the last couple stages of the review process, according to the State Department's attorney Robert Prince. In a filing last month, the State Department said it needed a one-month extension to release the final set of emails because approximately 7,000 pages of them had been misplaced for a period of several months before they could be sent to other government agencies to review. That error, State argued, compounded by a weather-related government closure, meant they wouldn't be able to get the final batch of emails out by the original January 29 deadline. Lawyers for journalist Jason Leopold, who is suing the State Department over the emails, argued the delay was unreasonable and would \"cause grave, incurable harm\" to voters in early presidential primary states who are deciding whether to vote for Clinton without being \"as fully informed as they would otherwise.\" Contreras seemed to agree, saying the timing of the release was important for the reasons cited. The judge also asked Prince whether the emails could be released to Leopold more expeditiously if they were not posted online, but the State Department argued it could take even longer to provide them to the plaintiff directly. Contreras had ordered the State Department to stick to a monthly production schedule for the emails last Spring, rejecting the State Department's request to release all the emails at once in January. The State Department had been progressing more or less on schedule until the discovery of the misplaced emails, which they've admitted was a mistake but have not explained in any detail.\n",
      "                             A hacked email exchange apparently shows Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman and a Democratic operative discussing the need to crush Vermont Sen. Bernie Sander's insurgent primary bid. On February 21, Washington lobbyist Joel Johnson, ?a seasoned Democratic activist who was a top White House adviser in President Bill Clinton's second term, emailed Podesta, saying Sanders \"needs to be ground to a pulp.\"  He titled the email, \"Friendly advice. No mercy.\" \"We can't start believing our own primary bulls---,\" Johnson wrote in the email. \"This is no time to run the general. Crush him as hard as you can. Other than that, hope all is well and congrats on Nevada!\" Hacked email appears to show DOJ official tipping Clinton campaign about review Podesta responded, \"I agree with that in principle. Where would you stick the knife in?\"  Johnson, who is now the managing director with The Glover Park Group in Washington, DC, responded, \"Obama betrayer (Wh will affirm). Hapless legislator (Senators/members will affirm). False promiser (policy elites will affirm). Can't win (black people will affirm).\" Messages left with both the Clinton campaign and The Glover Park Group were not immediately returned. The exchange is one of tens of thousands of emails stolen from Podesta's Gmail account and published by WikiLeaks in recent weeks. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of any of the emails but the Clinton campaign has not challenged any emails in other WikiLeaks releases.\n",
      "                             The FBI's decision to review new emails related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server is reinvigorating Donald Trump's faith in the US government and political system -- and in his own campaign. \"What happened today, starting with the FBI, maybe the system will become a little less rigged. Beautiful,\" the Republican nominee, who has repeatedly questioned what he deems a \"rigged system\" against him, said Friday night. It was the third and final rally of a day he argued has breathed new life into his struggling campaign. He argued his campaign is \"really moving\" in light of what he termed a \"disaster\" for Clinton's campaign and then the billionaire showman even capped off the outdoors rally on a riverbank here with a flashy fireworks display. \"The FBI would not have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious offense,\" Trump argued, even though the FBI has not said it is formally reopening the investigation into Clinton's email server. \"I've had a lot of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong.\" Pivoting back to his campaign, he added: \"We've had gaps, but we are really moving. I don't know what's going to happen now.\" Earlier in the day, FBI Director James Comey announced in a letter to members of Congress that through \"an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation\" of Clinton's email server. Comey directed investigators to \"review these emails to determine whether they contained classified information.\" The decision, which fell nearly four months after the FBI recommended no criminal charges following its investigation into Clinton's private email server, rocked the political world on Friday. It came just 11 days before Election Day as Trump faces a steep and narrow path to victory following a series of damaging revelations in recent weeks -- including sexual assault allegations and audio of Trump bragging about being able to grope women. If the fireworks shed light on Trump's mood, his supporters' ear-shattering shrieks, applause and chants of \"Lock her up!\" at each of his three rallies when Trump raised the \"critical breaking news\" left no doubt the FBI's surprise decision had reinvigorated his biggest fans. First pouncing on the news at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump first expressed hope that the FBI will \"right the horrible mistake that they made\" and lambasted Clinton as a corrupt candidate, even though no new evidence came to light on Friday. \"Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must never let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office,\" Trump said, reading from prepared remarks. \"I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.\" Clinton reacted to the FBI announcement during a brief news conference Friday afternoon, urging the FBI to release \"full and complete facts immediately.\" \"The director himself has said he doesn't know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not. I'm confident, whatever they are, will not change the conclusion reached in July. Therefore, it's imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay,\" Clinton said. A few hours later, Trump lobbed another attack at Clinton during a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, accusing Clinton of trying to \"politicize this investigation\" and of \"attacking and falsely accusing the FBI director,\" noting that Clinton claimed Comey sent a letter only to Republican members of Congress. The FBI director also sent the letter to top Democrats as well. \"The FBI would not have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious offense,\" Trump argued in Cedar Rapids. Accusations of collusion Trump's accusation that Clinton is trying to \"politicize\" the investigation and attacking the FBI director sits in stark contrast to Trump's own repeated and unrelenting attacks on the agency. Trump has repeatedly accused the FBI and DOJ of colluding to cover up Clinton's controversial use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. And while he made it clear Friday that he was not backing off that claim, Trump appeared cautiously optimistic that the FBI's latest announcement might finally yield the result he and his supporters have been clamoring for. Trump has argued Clinton should be jailed for storing several pieces of classified information on her private email server and misrepresenting that fact to the American public, though he did not explicitly say Friday that Clinton should be indicted or jailed. \"This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected,\" Trump said. Minutes later, he added: \"It might not be as rigged as I thought.\" \"The FBI, I think they're going to right the ship, folks, I think they're going to right the ship and they're going to save their great reputation by doing so,\" Trump said. While Trump remained stern-faced as he addressed the FBI's decision to investigate new emails related to Clinton's email server, Trump's supporters and his campaign staff were suddenly reinvigorated by the news. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, was being interviewed by Yahoo News' Bianna Golodryga when the news first broke. \"That is superb,\" Conway said after Golodryga told her. \"That is extraordinary news for the American people because they deserve to know everything.\" She later tweeted: \"A great day in our campaign just got even better.\" 'Long overdue' Trump's reaction to the FBI news echoed the response of other top Republican officials, including House Speaker Paul Ryan -- who has been critical of Trump but still supports him for president. Ryan called the FBI's decision \"long overdue\" and hammered Clinton for her \"reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators.\" \"Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame. She was entrusted with some of our nation's most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling classified information,\" Ryan said in a statement Friday. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called the news a \"stunning development\" and argued Clinton \"jeopardized classified information.\" Priebus also suggested the FBI's announcement raised questions about the 33,000 emails Clinton deleted from her private email server, which Trump has frequently raised on the stump. \"This stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law,\" Priebus said.\n",
      "                             Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Thursday to hold the architect of Hillary Clinton's private email server in contempt for failing to appear before them. The panel's 19-15 vote came after Bryan Pagliano failed to attend a second hearing on Clinton's emails and use of a private server while leading the State Department. Republicans blasted his decision as an act of defiance, but Pagliano's lawyers said the demand that he appear \"betrays a naked political agenda.\"  House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify.  \"I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server. This is indisputable,\" Chaffetz said. \"I also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt.\" RELATED: Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college map Pagliano was first called before the oversight committee last week but did not appear. Pagliano pleaded the Fifth Amendment in a closed-door hearing last year of the House panel investigating the Benghazi attacks. It is unclear when the full House would take up a vote on the contempt resolution approved Thursday. Pagliano's lawyers accused Chaffetz of launching a witch hunt. \"A subpoena issued by a congressional committee is required by law to serve a valid legislative purpose -- and there is none here. Your demand under the present circumstances, that Mr. Pagliano again assert his constitutional rights in front of video cameras six weeks before the presidential election, betrays a naked political agenda and furthers no valid legislative aim,\" Pagliano's lawyers wrote in a letter to the committee on Wednesday. RELATED: How to watch the first presidential debate Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the panel, defended Pagliano's refusal to appear.  \"There is no legitimate legislative purpose in forcing Mr. Pagliano to appear before the committee to assert his Fifth Amendment rights before Congress for a second time, and there is certainly no legitimate legislative purpose in forcing him to do so in public,\" Cummings said Thursday. The Clinton campaign said Thursday it had not told Pagliano whether or not to testify, and blasted the oversight hearings into her private email server. \"He made his own decision, but we certainly have not prevailed upon anyone to cooperate with this sham of an inquiry,\" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said. \"The career officials at the FBI and the Justice Department already thoroughly investigated this matter, and closed the case with no further action, and Jason Chaffetz is abusing his office with this blatantly partisan attempt to hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\"\n",
      "                             One of Hillary Clinton's top deputies at the State Department provided little in the way of justification for the way senior department officials viewed and apparently tacitly approved of Clinton's use of a private email server. Former State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills told lawyers from the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch she was \"not aware\" of any high-level discussion about Clinton's decision to use a private server for official communications, but her use of a personal account was understood, according to a deposition conducted last week that was released Tuesday. Coming just days after an inspector general's report criticized Clinton for violating State Department policy and the Federal Records Act by using the private server, Mills' statements seem to suggest that Clinton and her advisers overestimated the department's ability to automatically preserve emails exchanged with other government employees. Mills also refuted claims that the server was kept quiet, even though the IG report found no evidence that Clinton or her deputies sought approval for the unconventional account. \"Secretary Clinton emailed relatively a wide swath of folks, more than 100, certainly, in the department,\" Mills said. \"And so her use of her email was not something that was unknown.\" The nearly seven-hour deposition was conducted as part of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch against the State Department. While a federal judge barred the release of video from the deposition, the transcript was released on Tuesday. Mills further suggested that Clinton's decision to use a personal email was motivated by \"the convenience of being able to use a common device\" and wasn't given much thought. Clinton gave a similar explanation last year when news of her email practices first emerged. \"I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two,\" she told reporters at a news conference.  But the IG report also highlighted an exchange between Clinton and her deputy chief of staff for operations that offers a potentially conflicting account of why Clinton's email was set up the way it was. In November 2010, the report said, the deputy chief of staff of operations told Clinton that State Department employees were not receiving her emails.  \"We should talk about putting you on State email or releasing your email address to the department so you are not going to spam,\" he emailed her. Clinton responded: \"Let's get separate address or device but I don't want any risk of the personal being accessible.\" And Clinton's critics argue her decision to use the personal server exclusively was an attempt to circumvent the Federal Records Act, which requires personnel to preserve all official communications for archiving purposes, and to ensure they're available for public release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). It's also something the inspector general report criticized. \"At a minimum, Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with department business before leaving government service and, because she did not do so, she did not comply with the department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act,\" the report said. The IG report cites a particular email exchange from 2011, between Mills, Undersecretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, executive secretary Stephen Mull and deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin. In the exchange, Mull proposes providing Clinton with a State Department BlackBerry after her personal device experienced malfunctions. The device, which Mull noted \"would mask her identity, but which would also be subject to FOIA requests,\" was rejected by Abedin, who replied that it \"doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\" Mills, in last week's deposition, was asked whether she and her colleagues had considered the fact that Clinton's emails would be concealed from FOIA officials unless the individuals she corresponded with were archiving them. Mills said she was under the assumption that all Clinton's emails were being archived on the receiving end, but said she didn't give the matter much thought. \"Did anybody ever address any concerns that they couldn't access the secretary's account to respond to FOIA?\" a lawyer for Judicial Watch asked. \"I'm not aware of it,\" Mills said. \"They might have, and certainly from my standpoint I wish that had been something we thought about.\" Mills said she only discussed the genesis of the account and its configuration with Clinton after both had left the State Department. Because she now represents Clinton as an attorney, she would not go into detail about those conversations. The IG report found that that key officials \"were not asked to approve or otherwise review the use of Secretary Clinton's server and that they had no knowledge of approval or review by other Department staff.\"  Clinton rejected that conclusion by pointing to other secretaries of state who used personal email, including Colin Powell, in a Tuesday interview with MSNBC. She also dismissed the report's assertion that officials in the State Department were discouraged from talking about her email practices. The report specifically mentions an exchange between a staffer in the Bureau of Information Resource Management and her director. When the staffer raised concerns about the email server, the report says, \"the director stated that the mission of (the bureau) is to support the secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the secretary's personal email system again.\" \"I do not know who that person is or what that person might have said because it's not anything that I am aware of,\" Clinton told MSNBC. \"I emailed with hundreds of people ... I certainly never instructed anyone to hide the fact that I was using a personal email.\" Mills said she knew that Clinton was using a personal email account early on in her tenure at State, but viewed it as the \"continuation of a practice (Clinton) had been using when she was senator.\" Clinton's campaign has acknowledged that she transitioned from a personal AT&amp;T email account to the clintonemail.com server shortly after she became secretary of state, an account Mills supported. \"I recall that there was a point at which she had to transition her email address and told everyone that she had a new email address,\" Mills said. Because of the scope of Judicial Watch's lawsuit, last week's deposition focused primarily on the decision to set up a private server and the State Department's responsiveness to FOIA requests. However, the group is also seeking to depose Mills as part a separate lawsuit related to the email issue and could expand on their line of questioning at that time. If the judge in that case approves their proposal, they will have another opportunity to question Mills, as well as Clinton, under oath.\n",
      "                             Another former Secretary of State -- Condoleezza Rice -- has been drawn into the fray over who advised Hillary Clinton to use a private email server while she was America's top diplomat. An aide to Rice told CNN that Rice has \"no recollection\" of a conversation between Hillary Clinton and Colin Powell that reportedly took place at a 2009 dinner party of former Secretaries of State, during which Powell allegedly recommended that Clinton use a private email account. The Daily Caller was first to report that Rice had commented on the issue.  Georgia Godfrey, Rice's chief of Staff at Stanford University where she teaches, also told the conservative news outlet that \"Dr. Rice isn't doing any media right now. I can tell you, though, that she has no recollection of that conversation either.\"   It's unclear whether Rice was present specifically when Powell reportedly offered his advice,  although it was reported she attended the dinner party.  The conversation between Clinton and Powell was first reported by The New York Times, based on an excerpt from an upcoming book about Bill Clinton's post-presidential years by Joe Conason.  According to the Times, Madeleine Albright hosted the dinner party with other former Secretaries of State -- including Powell and Rice and Henry Kissinger -- to celebrate Clinton's appointment to the top diplomatic post. Each former Secretary offered Clinton advice, and Powell's advice was reportedly to use a personal email account. Powell, for his part, has also said he has \"no recollection\" of the reported dinner party conversation. He pushed back  on the story over the weekend, saying that Clinton's \"people are trying to pin it on me.\"  Neither Rice nor Powell has made a public presidential endorsement in the 2016 election cycle.  Following an investigation into the issue, FBI director James Comey recommended against any criminal charges to the Justice Department last month for Clinton over her use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State -- but Comey did characterize Clinton's behavior \"extremely careless\" in the handling of classified information.\n",
      "                             1. It won't satisfy conservatives or conspiracy theorists --  First, the takeaways that mean this email story will likely continue, at least among Clinton opponents. Second, she said she deleted a large number of personal emails. \"After I left office, the State Department asked former secretaries of state for our assistance in providing copies of work- related emails from our personal accounts. I responded right away and provided all my emails that could possibly be work-related, which totaled roughly 55,000 printed pages, even though I knew that the State Department already had the vast majority of them. We went through a thorough process to identify all of my work- related emails and deliver them to the State Department. At the end, I chose not to keep my private personal emails -- emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.\"   We'll have to take her word for it since those were deleted off the private server. Her word might satisfy some Democrats, but others will pursue the email story into the future. 2. \"The server will remain private\" --  Clinton made clear she won't be offering up the server to any third party or government agency.  \"The server will remain private,\" she said.  You can look at this either as Clinton not wanting her private email out in the public. Or you can look at it as if she has something to hide. Americans will remain split -- some will take her at her word, others will fervently doubt it. 3. It had been a while --  Despite being Democrats' top choice to be president, Hillary Clinton hadn't taken questions from reporters in about 5 months. It took the growing email scandal to get her in front of the press. 4. It was at the United Nations and Clinton really would rather have talked about diplomacy -- Clinton held the press availability -- they called it a \"press encounter\" in an announcement from the UN's in-house TV department -- at the United Nations.  Clinton isn't in official government business any more, but she was speaking at the UN in a speech to commemorate a speech she gave in Beijing as First Lady. That Beijing speech on International Women's Day was a pretty big deal at the time; she called out the Chinese government on Chinese soil and got a big round of applause for doing it.  \"Women's rights are human rights,\" she said back then in Beijing, arguing governments there and abroad have a responsibility to stand up for women. She brought that up in beginning the press conference. She also used strong language to criticize Republicans for sending a letter to Iran around the back of President Obama. After that, it was finally onto the emails. 5. A Turkish journalist asked the American political figure the first question -- UN policy is for the head of the correspondents association there to ask the first question. According to The Washington Post, Italian Giampaolo Pioli is in the Central African Republic. So it fell to the vice chair of the association, Kahraman Haliscelik, to ask the first question. The American reporters tried to crowd him out, but Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill made sure Clinton let Haliscelik speak first. Update: This article at first stated that Haliscelik didn't ask about the emails, but he did. He asked why she didn't use two handheld devices and if a man would have been treated differently. 6. Clinton's talking point was \"for convenience\" --  She said several times she made the decision to have on single email account \"for convenience.\" She said at the time, in order to have a separate state department and personal address, she would have had to have separate phones. President Obama's former speech writer, Jon Favreau, said on Twitter that government rules precluded use of a personal account on a government device before 2011.  7. There was one feisty exchange --  The ABC reporter Jonathan Karl demanded in a multi-part question to know why Clinton waited so long to turn over emails and whether this imbroglio would affect her decision to run for president. She answered the first, but didn't get to the second. 8. Hillary Clinton's yoga is now a thing --  Clinton said among the emails she deleted were yoga routines and other things you find in inboxes. It didn't take social media long to respond. Here's a \"yogabyhillary\" Twitter account.     \n",
      "                             A hacked email published by WikiLeaks this week shows that Democratic strategists -- including top political allies of Hillary Clinton -- were gauging voter attitudes about the Muslim faith of Barack Obama's father during Clinton's unsuccessful fight for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.   If this had come out in the midst of the 2008 Democratic primaries it would no doubt prompt angry comments from Obama campaign staffers and condemnations of attempts to other-ize the senator. But Democrats, not surprisingly, were mum Friday.  According to Tom Matzzie and Paul Begala, two Democratic consultants advising the 2008 polling effort by Progressive Media USA, it was simply an effort to test Obama's vulnerabilities in a potential general election against John McCain. Begala and Matzzie told CNN that the group also tested arguments against Clinton, a claim that is backed up by a separate hacked email available on WikiLeaks as Document ID 2187. \"This is Campaigning 101,\" said Matzzie, an Obama supporter in 2008 who was the president and executive director of Progressive Media USA. \"You test the vulnerabilities of your candidate -- something (Republicans) should have done for Donald Trump.\" The emails were published by WikiLeaks, which has now posted roughly 10,000 emails hacked from the account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Clinton's campaign has not confirmed the content or veracity of the emails.  \"We're still not confirming whether or not any of the WikiLeaks documents are authentic and are therefore not commenting on their content,\" Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said. In a January 9, 2008, email to Podesta, Begala, Matzzie and two others, an analyst at Stan Greenberg's Democratic polling firm proposed asking voters for their reaction to 15 potential Obama vulnerabilities. The list of anti-Obama arguments included this one about the faith of Obama's father: \"Obama (owe-BAHM-uh)'s father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the world's most populous Islamic country,\" an apparent reference to Obama's time in Indonesia.   Twelve percent of the poll respondents in 10 battleground states at the time thought that Obama's father being a Muslim and Obama growing up around Muslims was one of the top two reasons to vote against Obama. Progressive Media found that the most effective Republican argument against Obama was the notion that Obama favored raising taxes by \"$2 trillion.\" Twenty-one percent of poll respondents said that the tax argument was one of the best reasons to vote against Obama. Matzzie said that the polling project developed over a two-month period. Originally, it was going to test John Edwards in addition to Clinton and Obama, but he was dropped after he failed to win the Iowa caucuses and his chances at the nomination evaporated. \"It was pretty obvious Obama was going to be the nominee,\" Matzzie said. \"It was more important to understand attacks on him than it was two months earlier.\" Begala, who is now a CNN political commentator and an adviser to Priorities USA, a pro- Clinton super PAC, tells CNN that this email was labeled \"McCain survey\" because \"it was designed to test attacks that might come in the general election.\" Begala was hired by Progressive Media USA to advise the group. \"We could not coordinate with either campaign, and worked to prepare to defend either candidate in the general election,\" wrote Begala in an email to CNN. \"Our entire focus was the general election. Both Obama and Clinton supporters were, at the time, concerned the eventual nominee would emerge wounded and vulnerable for the general election.\" The group disbanded after the nomination fight was settled because Obama publicly urged his supporters to give money directly to his campaign not to independent political committees. Progressive Media USA received funding from George Soros, Steve Bing, the Service Employees International Union and others. In addition to gauging voter reactions to the Muslim faith of Obama's father, the polling team also proposed testing that Obama had described his former cocaine use as using \"a little blow.\" The group also tested Obama's support for driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, his stance on gay adoption, and his 2007 decision to stop wearing an American flag pin. The group tested multiple potential Republican arguments against Clinton including that she \"flip-flopped\" on driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, that she \"pandered to anti-war radicals\" by cutting off emergency funds for the Iraq War and that she has taken \"more money from lobbyists and special interests than any other candidate.\" \"We were trying to simulate an election against McCain,\" Matzzie said. \"If you don't include negative questions about your own candidates in the polling, the research is worthless because no real election is like that.\"\n",
      "                             Donald Trump tried to put one of the toughest weeks in his campaign behind him Monday by using a cybersecurity speech to veterans to hammer away at Hillary Clinton's email controversy. Trump hewed closely to his script Monday morning, promising as he read from a Teleprompter that he would order a complete review of the US cybersecurity capabilities and prepare offensives against global opponents.  And, just a few minutes into his talk before the Retired American Warriors PAC, he shifted to a sharply honed attack on Clinton. \"Has anybody put a server in their basement? Oh boy. Hillary Clinton's only experience in cybersecurity involves a criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive coverup and putting the nation in harm's way,\" Trump said.  Trump then hit Clinton on questions of whether she knowingly sent classified information through her private email server: \"The fact that a former senator and secretary of state claimed not to know what the letter 'C' means is just one more example of why she is totally unfit to hold the office of the president.\" The \"C\" label is a reference to the demarcation of an email as \"confidential,\" and came up during the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state.   The hard-hitting attack on Clinton comes one week after the first debate, where his supporters said they were disappointed that he didn't hit Clinton on her emails. It also follows a disastrous seven-day stretch dominated by an underwhelming debate performance, a feud with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, early morning Tweet storms and insinuations -- without evidence -- that Clinton cheated on her husband. The rocky stretch was capped with a report late Saturday in The New York Times that found Trump may have avoided paying federal taxes for 18 years.\n",
      "                             A State Department Inspector General report said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton failed to follow the rules or inform key department staff regarding her use of a private email server, according to a copy of the report obtained by CNN on Wednesday.  The report, which was provided to lawmakers, states, \"At a minimum, Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and, because she did not do so, she did not comply with the Department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act.\" The report examined record keeping laws, policies and practices at the State Department from 1997 to present.  In producing the report, the Inspector General's office interviewed former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, and Condoleezza Rice.  Clinton and several of her staff members during her tenure declined to be interviewed, the report said. The report draws attention to two staff members in the Office of Information Resources Management, who back in 2010 \"discussed their concerns about Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email account in separate meetings with the then-Director\" of their office. DOJ grants immunity to ex-Clinton staffer who set up email server The report says, \"According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary's personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further.\" The same director reportedly \"instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary's personal email system again.\" But the report notes that interviews with officials from the Under Secretary for Management and the Office of the Legal Adviser found \"no knowledge of approval or review by other Department staff\" of the server. Official: Hacker who claimed Clinton server break-in expected to plead guilty to separate charge Clinton has long maintained that she had permission to use personal email.  She told CNN's Brianna Keilar in July that \"the truth is everything I did was permitted and I went above and beyond what anybody could have expected in making sure that if the State Department didn't capture something, I made a real effort to get it to them.\" But the report says that the Inspector General's office \"found no evidence that the Secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server.\" Robert Gates: I question Hillary Clinton's judgment on email server In a statement following the report's release, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon, wrote that \"While political opponents of Hillary Clinton are sure to misrepresent this report for their own partisan purposes, in reality, the Inspector General documents just how consistent her email practices were with those of other Secretaries and senior officials at the State Department who also used personal email.\"  But while the report acknowledges personal email use by previous secretaries, it also notes that the rules for preserving work emails sent from a personal email account were updated in 2009, the year Clinton took office. Opinion: Clinton's big worry The National Archives and Records Administration regulation, according to the report, says that \"Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record keeping system.\" Fallon told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Wednesday afternoon that \"at the time that she took office and for the duration of her tenure there, the use of personal email for work purposes was not disallowed.\"  He attributed issues with retention of emails to \"shoddy\" record keeping at the State Department. When asked why Clinton did not accept the inspector general's request to be interviewed, Fallon said that Clinton had prioritized the Justice Department's investigation into the email server.  \"We never could quite make sense of why this review by the State Department IG was proceeding on its own timeline in a parallel fashion to the Justice Department review,\" he said. Fallon also said the inspector general's office may have exhibited an \"anti-Clinton bias.\"  \"There were questions raised about this office during the course of its investigation; there were reports about individuals in this office coming forward and suggesting there were hints of an anti-Clinton bias inside that office,\" he said.   The department's inspector general was appointed by the Obama administration.  State Department spokesman Mark Toner briefed reporters Wednesday: \"While not necessarily encouraged, there was no prohibition on using personal email. The only requirement is that -- and the regulations do state this, that these records need to be preserved.\" Department officials told reporters on a conference call that Secretary of State John Kerry had asked the inspector general to undertake this review in March 2015. The officials said that the department had already decided to accept all eight of the recommendations made in the report. This is not the first time Clinton's use of a private email has been criticized by an inspector general.  In January the inspector general for intelligence agencies wrote a letter to Congress saying that two government agencies flagged emails on Clinton's server as containing classified information, the inspector general said, including some on \"special access programs,\" which are a subset of the highest \"Top Secret\" level of classification, but are under subject to more stringent control rules than even other Top Secret information.\" At the time a Clinton campaign spokesman alleged that the Inspector General for intelligence agencies had been intentionally leaking seemingly damaging information in collusion with Senate Republicans. Clinton's campaign and the State Department have long denied that any information was handled improperly, saying that the information and emails in question were all retroactively classified.\n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton told the FBI that her predecessor Colin Powell recommended that she use a private email account during her tenure as Secretary of State, according to a new report. The New York Times reported on the revelation Thursday, based on notes from Clinton's interview with the FBI about her server that were delivered to Congress this week, and on a preview of a book about Bill Clinton's post-presidential years.  The notes from the FBI's interview with Clinton, conducted during its probe of the issue, reveal that she told investigators that Powell had advised her to use a private account. Additionally, an excerpt from journalist Joe Conason's upcoming book on Bill Clinton, \"Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton,\" provides more detail.  In the book, Conason recounts a scene at a dinner party in 2009 -- attended by other former Secretaries of State, including host Madeleine Albright, Condoleezza Rice and Henry Kissinger, in addition to Powell -- where they each offered Clinton guidance and advice as she prepared to take the reins of the State Department.  According to Conason's book, it was at this dinner that Powell told Clinton to use a personal email account.  As the Times reports, Conason wrote, \"Toward the end of the evening, over dessert, Albright asked all of the former secretaries to offer one salient bit of counsel to the nation's next top diplomat. Powell told her to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer.\" Reached for comment, Powell's team told CNN he has \"no recollection\" of the conversation described in Conason's book, though he did provide her a memo regarding his own email use at the State Dept. Powell Principal Assistant Peggy Cifrinio's said in a statement that the former secretary of state did write Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages.  \"At the time there was no equivalent system within the Department,\" Cifrinio said. \"He used a secure State computer on his desk to manage classified information. The General no longer has the email he sent to former Secretary Clinton. It may exist in State or FBI files.\" Cifrinio referred to Powell's memoir, \"It Worked For Me,\" where he discussed his use of a private email address while Secretary of State, for more detail.  CNN has reached out to the Clinton campaign and has not yet received a response.  Conason also says Clinton had decided to use a personal account before the episode with Powell, though Powell's advice \"confirmed\" her thinking.  \"Saying that his use of a personal email had been transformative for the department, (Powell) thus confirmed a decision (Clinton) had made months earlier -- to keep her personal account and use it for most messages,\" Conason wrote. While Clinton has pointed to Powell and Rice as examples of previous Secretaries of State who used their personal email accounts, advancements in email technology and the widespread adoption of email for government use since Powell's term cast Clinton's use of a private email account in a sharply different light. Powell worked at the State Dept. during email's infancy, operating on an antiquated system through which he would have sent far fewer emails.  Furthermore, though Powell admitted to using personal email account on the job, he did not set up a private email server at his personal residence the way that Clinton did in Chappaqua, New York.  Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State emerged as a major flashpoint in the 2016 presidential election, raising questions about Clinton's judgment, transparency and honesty.  While the FBI ultimately decided that Clinton's actions didn't warrant criminal prosecution after an investigation, critics have highlighted the issue as an example of an unfair standard of justice for the Clintons. Others have questioned Clinton's motives for establishing her unprecedented private email network. \n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton repeatedly told the FBI she couldn't recall key details and events related to classified information procedures, according to notes the bureau released Friday of its July interview with the Democratic presidential nominee, along with a report on its investigation into her private email server.  Clinton told the FBI she \"could not recall any briefing or training by State related to the retention of federal records or handling classified information,\" according to the bureau's notes of their interview with Clinton. The documents indicate Clinton told investigators she either does not \"recall\" or \"remember\" at least 39 times ? often in response to questions about process, potential training or the content of specific emails. Much of the report reiterated what FBI Director James Comey testified in open hearings before Congress, including that more than six dozen email chains contained classified information at the time they were sent and that there appeared to have been hacking attempts on her server, though there is no evidence they were successful. Still, the report added fuel to the criticisms of Clinton and the narrative that her team acted \"extremely careless,\" as Comey said. GOP nominee Donald Trump and other Republicans have stepped up their attacks connecting the emails to questions over whether Clinton gave preferential treatment to donors to her family's foundation. The release of the documents Friday comes as Clinton's lead over Trump has been cut in half since her post-convention bounce last month, according to CNN's Poll of Polls released Thursday. The bureau is making the information public in response to numerous Freedom of Information Act requests, including from CNN.  \"Today the FBI is releasing a summary of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's July 2, 2016 interview with the FBI concerning allegations that classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on a personal e-mail server she used during her tenure,\" the agency said in a statement. \"We also are releasing a factual summary of the FBI's investigation into this matter.\" Presidential campaign ramifications   The publication of the FBI report is likely to give a new burst of political life to the controversy over Clinton's private server.  The episode plays directly into Republican claims that Clinton is dishonest, abhors transparency and lacks the ethical standards required of someone who sits in the Oval Office. It also allows Trump's campaign to suggest to voters that they will be setting up a repeat of the cycle of scandals, controversy, and investigations that dragged on through the entire presidency of Bill Clinton and which tainted Hillary Clinton at the same time. \"Hillary Clinton's answers to the FBI about her private email server defy belief,\" Trump said in a statement. \"I was absolutely shocked to see that her answers to the FBI stood in direct contradiction to what she told the American people. After reading these documents, I really don't understand how she was able to get away from prosecution.\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, meanwhile, called the release a \"devastating indictment\" of Clinton's honesty and judgment. Clinton's campaign, however, said it was \"pleased\" by the release. \"While her use of a single email account was clearly a mistake and she has taken responsibility for it, these materials make clear why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case,\" Clinton's national press secretary Brian Fallon said in a statement.  'Oh s***' The FBI report also provided detail on mass deletions of Clinton's email server by the company maintaining her server, Platte River Networks, after the existence of it came to light.   According to the investigation report, top Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills told a PRN worker whose name was redacted in December 2014 that Clinton wanted her email to only be retained for 60 days, and instructed him to reset the retention policy on her email account. But the individual told the FBI he realized that he had failed to do so until after The New York Times published its bombshell story revealing Clinton's private server and email use, prompting an \"'oh s***' moment.\" \"In a follow-up FBI interview on May 3, 2016, (name redacted) indicated he believed he had an 'oh s***' moment and sometime between March 25-31, 2015, deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the PRN server and used BleachBit to delete the exported .PST files he had created on the server system containing Clinton's emails,\" the report stated.  The mass deletion occurred after the March 2, 2015, Times story and after a March 3, 2015, preservation order from the House Benghazi Committee to retain and produce documents related to her email accounts. Mills had sent this request to PRN and this individual on March 9, 2015, and under repeat questioning by the FBI, the individual admitted he was aware that the request existed and meant he shouldn't disturb the files on PRN's server. Both Mills and Clinton told the FBI they were not aware of the mass deletion that March. Colin Powell One of the findings revealed in the report is that former Secretary of State Colin Powell \"warned\" Clinton that her emails could become government record in 2009. According to the report summarizing the FBI's investigation, Clinton emailed Powell just after inauguration in 2009 about his use of a BlackBerry as secretary of state.  \"Powell warned Clinton that if it became 'public' that Clinton had a BlackBerry, and she used it to 'do business,' her emails could become 'official record(s) and subject to the law,'\" the report stated. \"Powell further advised Clinton, 'Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.'\"  But the FBI said Clinton described her understanding of Powell's comments as saying that work-related emails would be official record, adding \"Powell's comments did not factor into her decision to use a personal email account.\" Before it became public, interest in the contents of the report had intensified after it was reported that Clinton told the FBI a conversation with Powell recommending she use private email helped convince her to do so. Powell repudiated the idea that he shares any responsibility for her choice in the following days, however, and Clinton told CNN's Anderson Cooper last month that she takes full responsibility.  \"I've been asked many, many questions in the past year about emails. And what I've learned is that when I try to explain what happened it can sound like I'm trying to excuse what I did,\" she told CNN. \"And there are no excuses. I want people to know that the decision to have a single e- mail account was mine. I take responsibility for it. I've apologized for it. I would certainly do differently if I could.\" Powell rejects Clinton email defense Use of mobile devices The report also described the way Clinton used her BlackBerry mobile devices. Clinton has cited her desire to use a single BlackBerry as part of her motivation to use a personal email address. Clinton's aide Huma Abedin told the FBI that Clinton often would use a new BlackBerry for a few days before returning to an older model because of her familiarity, according to the report. The FBI found that 13 different mobile devices were used with her two known phone numbers, and thus may have sent emails with her private account. After Clinton switched to a new device, the previous incarnation would often disappear, and a former Bill Clinton aide, Justin Cooper, said he could recall two times he destroyed the old device either by breaking it in half or hitting it with a hammer. The findings also noted that Clinton stored her BlackBerry in a desk drawer in her office, which was not authorized. Her office was in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), and thus the use of mobile devices in the office was prohibited. The former Assistant Secretary of State for State Diplomatic Security Service Eric Boswell told the FBI that he \"never received any complaints about Clinton using her personal BlackBerry inside the SCIF.\"  According to Abedin, Cooper and another person whose name was redacted from the report, there were personally owned desktop computers in the SCIFs in Clinton's homes in Washington and Chappaqua, New York. Clinton had stated to the FBI she did not have a computer of any kind in the SCIFs in her residences. Abedin and Clinton said the former secretary of state did not use a computer and primarily used her BlackBerry or iPad for checking emails. Handing of classified information The notes revealed that Clinton relied heavily on her staff and aides to determine what was classified information and how it should be handled.  \"Clinton did not recall receiving any emails she thought should not be on an unclassified system,\" the FBI notes said. \"She relied on State official to use their judgment when emailing her and could not recall anyone raising concerns with her regarding the sensitivity of the information she received at her email address.\" Clinton was also asked about the (C) markings within several documents that James Comey testified before Congress represented classified information. The emails that were sent and received from her server containing these markings became the subject of intense debate on the Hill, as her critics seized on them as evidence that she mishandled information. But Clinton told the FBI she was unaware of what the marking meant. \"Clinton stated she did not know and could only speculate it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order,\" the interview notes stated.  The former secretary of state said she did understand when an email was marked \"confidential\" at the top, and \"asked the interviewing agents if that was what 'c' referenced,\" according to the notes. The confidential label had been placed there by the FBI after the fact.  She also said she didn't \"pay attention to the 'level' of classified information and took all classified information seriously.\" The interview also addressed a 2011 email in which Clinton said she hadn't received talking points from her aide, Jake Sullivan. He responded that there were issues sending the document through secure fax.  \"If they can't,\" Clinton replies, \"turn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure.\" That email had been the fuel behind speculation that Cilnton had demanded her aide send classified information through a nonsecure channel by removing markings. But Clinton told the FBI that she understood the request as routine.  \"Clinton thought a 'nonpaper' was a way to convey the unofficial stance of the US government to a foreign government and believed this practice went back '200 years,'\" she said, according to interview notes. \"When viewing the displayed email, Clinton believed she was asking Sullivan to remove\n",
      "                             An email from a WikiLeaks hack revealed that Neera Tanden, who currently helps run the Clinton campaign transition team, suggested Hillary Clinton's top aides never disclosed her use of a private email servers because \"they wanted to get away with it.\" Tanden, the president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, emailed Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta in March 2015 after news broke that Clinton used a private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State. \"Why didn't they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,\" Tanden wrote to Podesta in March 2015, referencing Clinton's campaign. Tanden then referenced Cheryl Mills, one of Clinton's top aides at the time, writing in another email, \"This is a cheryl special. Know you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heal (sic). Or kryptonite. she just can't say no to this sh--. Why didn't they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy.\" Podesta responded to her email, writing \"Unbelievable.\" Clinton aide in hacked email: Need to 'clean up' Obama answer on email server \"I guess I know the answer,\" Tanden wrote back. \"They wanted to get away with it.\" Neither Tanden nor the Clinton campaign immediately responded to requests for comment. And then in an another email, Tanden wrote, \"a thought that I'm sure has occurred to you hours ago: the archives request them and she complies immediately (avoids subpeonas) don't yell at me.\" These emails are part of a wider hack of Podesta's emails published by WikiLeaks. The group has released emails hacked from Podesta's private gmail account daily for more than two weeks. The Clinton campaign has refused to confirm or deny specific emails' authenticity and has accused the Russian government of being behind their theft and release -- a claim WikiLeaks and the Russians have denied. It appears that Tanden was asking why Mills and the other top aide didn't automatically send Clinton's emails to the archives instead of trying to find a way not to hand them over to protect Clinton. CNN cannot independently confirm the emails' authenticity. But the Clinton campaign has not challenged any emails in other WikiLeaks releases. Many of the emails released by WikiLeaks have focused on the fallout from Clinton's private email server use. The campaign team and top aides were involved in lengthy email threads gaming out the response, from statements to the media, to responses to congressional inquiries, to even tweets on the topic.  Tanden had also been a frequent character in the emails. As president of CAP and veteran of Obama and Clinton world, Tanden represented a progressive flank of the party and had a close relationship with Podesta, who helped found and lead CAP before stepping down in 2011.  In the emails, she frequently used colorful language to describe opponents of the campaign on the left, right or in the media, and also sometimes had criticisms of the candidate or campaign itself, though she described herself as a \"loyal soldier\" for Clinton. \n",
      "                             Ted Cruz takes a swing in a new ad at Hillary Clinton's email server controversy with a spoof of a famous scene from the cult classic comedy \"Office Space.\" In the 1999 movie, a group of software company workers drag a chronically malfunctioning printer into an open field to stomp on and pulverize it with a baseball bat. Cruz's spot adjusts the frame a bit, substituting in a Clinton character, along with a couple of her aides, and exchanging the printer for a computer drive. The musical backing will be familiar to the movie's fans -- a neat parody of the Geto Boys' 1992 single \"Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta.\" Cruz's version begins, \"Damn it feels good to be a Clinton. A shameless politician always plays her cards right.\" It goes on to call out the press for keeping \"their their mouths tight\" in defense of the \"entitled\" former secretary of state and former president.  \"A Clinton plays the victim for promotion, a Clinton kills it off with a smile,\" the lyrics continue. \"Damn it feels good to be a Clinton, a server full of secrets ain't no thing. Damn it feels good to be a Clinton, nothing ever hits with a sting.\" And with that, the actress playing Hillary Clinton drives one final heel into the battered computer tower. The ad will air during \"Saturday Night Live\" in South Carolina statewide, a spokesperson for the Cruz campaign said.  The new Cruz spot comes after another one of his ads was pulled down on Thursday after it was revealed that one of the actors had performed in erotic films. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n",
      "                             Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Sunday that the Justice Department probe into Hillary Clinton's emails is being conducted the same as similar investigations and that she has not discussed it with President Barack Obama.  \"I don't get involved in whom the President endorses and I don't have comments, as I said before, on any of the candidates,\" said Lynch when asked on \"Fox News Sunday\" if her status as a political appointee by Obama created a conflict of interest for her now that Obama has endorsed Clinton. \"The investigation into the State Department email matter is going to be handled like any other matter. We've got career agents and lawyers looking at that. They will follow the facts and follow the evidence wherever it leads and come to a conclusion,\" she said. Lynch said she has not discussed the investigation with Obama or anyone else in the White House. \"We've never discussed the Clinton case. I have never spoken about it with the President or really with anyone at the White House. That's not the kind of relationship that I have with people there, and it would be inappropriate to do so,\" she said.  Lynch made similar comments on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, saying the investigation was \"free from politics,\" and deflected a question of whether she should recuse herself.  \"I say let the career prosecutors and agents do their job and continue in this matter,\" she said.\n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton has called the use of private email for official business by multiple senior Trump White House advisers -- reportedly including Jared Kushner, Stephen Bannon, and Reince Priebus -- the \"height of hypocrisy.\"  While there are both legal and factual distinctions between the two situations, Clinton's criticism is valid. Comparing the two situations is appropriate and may become more so as the facts further develop.  While the Federal Records Act applied to Clinton's emails, the comparable Presidential Records Act requires the preservation of records of the president and his advisers. Presidential records include almost any material related to the president's activities whether they are documents, texts, tweets, recorded conversations, or emails.  While \"personal\" documents are excluded from the definition of presidential records, the exception is narrowly confined to communications of a \"purely private\" nature.  The Presidential Records Act also specifically prohibits the president and his advisers from using a \"non-official\" email account to send a presidential record, unless they copy the message to their official email account or forward it to the official account within 20 days.  While Kushner's lawyer Abbe Lowell has asserted, \"All non-personal emails were forwarded to his official address,\" he did not specify whether this was done within the law's time limit or belatedly in response to this controversy, or who determined which of his private emails were \"non-personal.\" Just as with Clinton, the public is being asked to trust that senior government officials who used private email for official business nevertheless both preserved all relevant emails and properly distinguished between personal and official records. This is trust the public should not have to give. The purpose of the Presidential Records Act, originally passed in 1978 as a reaction to the Watergate scandal, was to establish public ownership over presidential records and to take them out of the hands of individuals with an incentive to destroy or conceal incriminating documents.  The use of private email by senior Trump White House advisers creates an unacceptable risk that the activities of the Trump White House will not be properly documented, ongoing investigations by Congress and special counsel Robert Mueller will be undermined, and the historical record will be damaged.  The other risk of private email, highlighted throughout the Clinton controversy, is that classified or sensitive information might be maintained outside of government control. While there is not yet any public evidence to suggest that the private emails of Trump advisers contained classified information, it would be premature to conclude that there was none.  Given the heightened sensitivity of communications related to the presidency, any assertion that dozens, if not hundreds, of emails sent between senior White House advisers did not contain any information that would be redacted as classified strains credulity.   His lawyer's carefully worded statement that Kushner's private emails \"usually\" were \"forwarded news articles or political commentary\" does not diminish the possibility of classified information. Former White House chief of staff John Podesta once described how even news articles often became stamped as classified in the White House on the basis that mere presidential interest in a news article could constitute strategic, sensitive information. Also, recall that one of the classified emails featured in the Clinton controversy reportedly resulted from an employee forwarding a newspaper article on the use of drones.  Presidential records, unlike federal records at the State Department, are not immediately subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Given this, assertions that the private emails in the Trump White House contained no classified information may have a longer shelf life than similar assertions by Clinton, but they are not necessarily any more credible.   While Clinton's exclusive use of private email and a private server may have been larger in scale, the Trump White House's \"occasional\" use of private email must also be placed in the context of a larger pattern of evading records laws.  This includes former chief strategist Stephen Bannon's reported desire to limit the White House \"paper trail,\" the apparent use of encrypted messaging apps by White House staff that automatically deleted communications, the continuing deletion of presidential tweets, and an ongoing lawsuit against Trump for violations of the Presidential Records Act.  Further, while Clinton's claims that she initially believed that her use of private email was consistent with the law and State Department policy was at least plausible, the Clinton email controversy itself renders any assertions by Trump advisers that private email use about official business was appropriate effectively unbelievable.  In the end, drawing any final conclusions or comparisons will require more facts. A congressional request is seeking such facts about the extent of private email usage by the Trump White House and its compliance with the law.  While many believe Clinton's emails were overemphasized during the campaign, and while possible violations of the Presidential Records Act may be dwarfed by other Trump White House investigations, the use of private emails by Trump advisers deserves the same level of scrutiny as Clinton's emails. Those who led chants of \"Lock her up!\" are not entitled to special leniency in the application of the law.\n",
      "                             House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said Monday he will continue to investigate Hillary Clinton's use of a primary email server while leading the State Department, but claimed he \"won't be a cheerleader\" for President-elect Donald Trump. \"Just because there was a political election doesn't mean it goes away,\" the Utah Republican said of the Clinton investigation. He called the classified emails that surfaced on the server \"the largest breach of security in the history of the State Department.\" The FBI decided not to recommend charges against Clinton, though their months-long investigation -- and last-minute reopening of it -- cast a pall over her campaign. Chaffetz also told reporters his committee will continue its executive oversight role ?and said that could include probing issues arising in the Trump administration. \"My job is not to be a cheerleader for the president,\" he said. When asked about Trump's potential business conflicts the chairman noted that the law? exempts the president of the United States, calling the push from Democrats to launch a committee investigation on Trump's business ties \"premature at best.\"  Chaffetz also sidestepped a question about potential conflicts for Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, tapped to be a senior adviser, saying he just learned about his role. But he said he planned to talk to the incoming White House Counsel, Don McGahn, soon. On laws regarding conflicts and the president, Chaffetz said \"maybe some of that should be tightened up.\" \"I will not shy away from taking a look,\" he said of his role under the Trump administration. \"It's not going to be pleasant sometimes.\" He also vowed to continue investigating the costs of the Epipen, and said the company \"fed us a bunch of bull.\"\n",
      "                             State Department officials cannot identify which staff members and officials may have used Hillary Clinton's private email server to conduct government business, government lawyers said in a new court filing released Thursday. Judicial Watch, which is fighting the State Department in one of a series of lawsuits seeking information on how the Clinton team used email in the State Department, announced Thursday that State lawyers could not track which employees were conducting business on the Clinton email server. Asked in a court interrogatory about who had used clintonemail.com addresses to conduct government business, State Department lawyers objected to the question by saying they had \"no method of identifying\" who was using the private email system. \"State objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it never possessed or controlled clintonemail.com, does not now possess or control clintonemail.com, and thus has no method of identifying which State Department officials and employees had and/or used an account on clintonemail.com to conduct official government business,\" lawyers wrote in the filing, released by Judicial Watch Thursday. Clinton herself and top aide Huma Abedin have both said they used the private email server -- but it's unclear if other top Clinton aides, including Jake Sullivan, also used clintonemail.com addresses. A State Department spokeswoman did not return a request for comment Thursday afternoon. Government lawyers objected repeatedly in the court filing to Judicial Watch's questions, which they deemed \"vague\" and \"overbroad.\" For instance, when asked, \"Who was responsible for the inventorying or other accounting of Mrs. Clinton's and Ms. Abedin's emails, records, and information?\" the State Department's lawyers objected to the use of the terms \"responsible,\" \"inventorying,\" \"accounting,\" and \"information,\" before briefly answering the question.\n",
      "                             A State Department spokesman on Thursday questioned why those with knowledge of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email didn't provide better information, adding \"there was only a partial understanding of how much Secretary Clinton relied on personal email.\" The spokesman, Mark Toner, told reporters that \"the people who may have had a broader knowledge or a fuller appreciation of -- to the extent at which Secretary Clinton was using her personal email -- are no longer here at the department.\" He added, \"They are now, many of them, with Secretary Clinton. And frankly, I would just have to ask you to ask them to answer that question: Whether it was how much they knew? And if they knew that she was relying significantly or solely on personal email, why didn't they make this -- others aware of it? I just can't answer that question.\" Clinton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Thursday that \"personal email use was the practice under other secretaries of state, and the rules were not clarified until after I had left.\" But, she added, \"As I have said many times, it was still a mistake. If I could go back, I would do it differently.\" \"I believed it was allowed, but that's not the point. I've said it was a mistake,\" Clinton added. In the first of at least seven depositions pertaining to Clinton's email usage, the former State Department deputy executive secretary, Lewis Lukens, revealed that Clinton's staff told him that she was \"not adept\" at using a computer and that the staff had sought a special room to enable BlackBerry access. The depositions are part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit focused on the department's handling of Freedom of Information Act requests. This information comes to light as the State Department Inspector General issued a report criticizing Clinton's email practices.  In the exchange, Lukens discussed how Clinton's then-chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, had talked to him about allowing Clinton to maintain access to her email even though mobile devices, including her BlackBerry, were prohibited from being used in her office due to it being a secured facility.        Mills will be deposed Friday at an undisclosed location for up to seven hours. She persuaded a judge Thursday to prevent Judicial Watch from releasing video of the deposition, so a transcript will be made public soon after her deposition concludes. Lukens, who described his role as \"logistics and management support,\" said he thought Clinton wanted access to private email \"for her to stay touch with family and friends\" and not for official business. He revealed how he had offered to set up a dedicated desktop computer in Clinton's office that would not be connected to the State Department's communication systems.  Lukens said he opted for this solution because although personal email could be checked on standard government computers connected to the department's system, he described the process as \"cumbersome\" because passwords had to be changed every eight to 12 weeks. He said the proposed computer for Clinton would not require a password. In response to his proposal, Lukens said Mills told him that Clinton was \"very comfortable checking her emails on a BlackBerry but she's not adept or not used to checking her emails on a desktop.\" Judicial Watch, a conservative legal watchdog group, asked to interview Lukens because of an email exchange he was party to, which they obtained from the State Department earlier this year.  The group has filed more than a dozen Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the State Department in the past year.\n",
      "                             Americans have not heard the last of Hillary Clinton's emails. Republicans pumped FBI Director James Comey Thursday for fresh evidence to prolong the politically damaging saga during a Capitol Hill hearing that ignited partisan anger over his decision not to seek charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. GOP lawmakers vented frustration that Clinton escaped criminal action over her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state while Democrats blasted the hearing as no more than a tax-payer funded witch-hunt. The four-and-a-half hour hearing, however, appeared to eke out several new seams for Republicans to pursue. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said he would ask the FBI to probe whether Clinton lied to Congress over her email arrangements. The agency, Comey said, did not investigate Clinton's testimony before the House Benghazi panel last year because Congress had not asked it to. \"I think when you come to Congress you need to provide truthful testimony and if you don't provide truthful testimony there should be a consequence,\" Chaffetz told reporters after the hearing. \"I thought the FBI was looking at this, but evidently, they're not. They weren't looking at it.\" Comey also testified that while people copied on Clinton emails had security clearances, some contractors who maintained the server and lawyers who examined her emails did not. Republicans tried to build an impression that Clinton repeatedly misled the American public over her motives and use of the private server system -- something Republicans hope will highlight questions about her trustworthiness. South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy asked Comey a series of questions rooted in the former secretary of state's statements on the issue. \"Secretary Clinton said there was nothing marked classified on her emails, either sent or received. Was that true?\" Gowdy asked. \"That's not true,\" Comey replied. \"Secretary Clinton said, 'I did not e-mail any classified material to anyone on my e-mail, there is no classified material.' Was that true?\" Gowdy went on. \"There was classified material emailed,\" Comey replied. As the politicians played for the cameras, Comey sat unruffled, vigorously defending the FBI probe and explaining why the presumptive Democratic nominee escaped indictment even though he had fired off a withering critique of her handling of classified information on Tuesday. \"I think she was extremely careless. I think she was negligent -- that I could establish,\" Comey told the House Oversight and Government Reform panel. \"What we can't establish is that she acted with the necessary criminal intent.\" While Comey was the witness, Clinton was clearly the target of the hearing as Republicans seek to keep the controversy over her email setup alive to highlight her most glaring vulnerability heading into November's election, questions about her character and honesty. \"There is no consequence, director -- there is no consequence,\" Chaffetz said, demanding to know why Clinton and her aides do not appear to be paying a price over the long-running controversy. \"We are mystified and confused by the fact pattern that you laid out and the conclusions that you reached,\" said Chaffetz, adding that \"the Average Joe\" would have been led off in handcuffs had they done what Clinton did. Trump meets with more than 200 House Republicans Comey also testified that there were three emails found on Clinton's servers bearing the letter \"C\" which denotes they were classified, in apparent contradiction of the former secretary of state's statements. But he said it was not clear whether Clinton knew that such a designation denoted classified material, saying \"the secretary may not have been as sophisticated as people assume\" when it comes to such issues. But Comey testified that Clinton did not lie to the FBI during their year long probe which culminated with her interview with bureau agents on Saturday and explained that the agency did not want to \"put people in jail unless we can prove they knew they were doing something they shouldn't do.\" And, following Attorney General Loretta Lynch's announcement Wednesday that she would accept the FBI's findings and close the case, Comey explained the legal distinction that underpinned his decision not to seek charges. \"My conclusion was and remains that no reasonable prosecutor would bring ... the second case in 100 years for gross negligence,\" Comey said. He explained that under relevant statutes, prosecutors would have to prove Clinton clearly knew she was breaking the law to win a case. \"Should have known, must have known, had to know, does not get you there,\" he said. The Clinton campaign argued after the hearing that it had been a mistake for Republicans to put Comey, a former prosecutor who served in President George W. Bush's Republican administration, on the spot. \"If you were a House Republican sitting on the panel today, you probably felt like that hearing backfired,\" Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on CNN's \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,\" arguing that the GOP had tried to use the hearing to create a \"drip, drip\" of coverage that would keep the issue in the news. Fallon also said that all of the lawyers who sorted Clinton's emails did in fact have security clearances, contradicting Comey's comments. And asked whether Clinton had lied to Congress, Fallon replied: \"Of course not.\" Committee Democrats spent the hearing portraying the whole affair as yet another attempt by Republicans -- following the House Select Committee on Benghazi -- to use the mechanics of government to wound their presidential nominee. \"In their eyes, you had one job -- and one job only -- to prosecute Hillary Clinton,\" the Committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, told Comey. \"But you refused, so now you are being summoned here to answer for your alleged transgressions.\" Hours after Comey's hearing, the State Department announced it had reopened its probe into Clinton's email use, an investigation that will focus on whether current employees involved in handling or sending and receiving Clinton's emails should get disciplinary action. The department had suspended its probe while it was waiting for the Justice Department to complete its criminal investigation. As the drama unfolded in a House hearing room, Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump was elsewhere on Capitol Hill, meeting GOP House and Senate lawmakers. Clinton was also in Washington Thursday, huddling with senior advisers at her home just off Embassy Row. Republicans are trying other avenues to keep the email controversy that has clouded her presidential campaign for months, alive. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for instance, asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to block access to classified briefings for Clinton for the rest of the campaign.  Trump, Rubio fundraise off Comey's testimony Trump sent out a fundraising email during the hearing, complaining that the FBI had let Clinton \"off the hook.\" \"We know the FBI refused to hold Lying Crooked Hillary accountable. But working together, we can hold her feet to the fire,\" Trump wrote. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio sent out a similar solicitation for his re-election bid, arguing that the email saga proved Clinton was unfit to serve as President. \"If Hillary becomes president, this will not be the last scandal the American people will endure,\" Rubio warned.\n",
      "                             Catholic and evangelical groups slammed Hillary Clinton's campaign in a statement Thursday over comments revealed in the WikiLeaks emails hack between two high-level campaign officials. Dozens of religious leaders who signed the statement expressed their \"outrage at the demeaning and troubling rhetoric used by those within Secretary Clinton's campaign.\" The statement is referring to a 2011 email between campaign chairman John Podesta, whose email was hacked, and communications director Jennifer Palmieri and John Halpin, a senior fellow at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress. Palmieri doesn't recognize controversial email about Catholics In the email, Halpin wrote that 21st Century Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch and NewsCorp Chairman Robert Thomson, who are both Catholic, are attracted to the faith because of \"systemic thought and severely backward gender relations.\" Palmieri responded: \"I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable, politically conservative religion -- their rich friends wouldn't understand if they became evangelical.\" The religious leaders said in the statement, \"Podesta's refusal to raise any objection makes him equally party to this bigotry. It is inexcusable. It is shameful. It is un-American.\"  WikiLeaks has not released all of Podesta's hacked emails and CNN has not been able to verify that they are his, so it's unclear if he raised any objection. Palmieri -- who is Catholic, according to campaign spokesman Brian Fallon -- told reporters Wednesday that she \"didn't recognize (the email) but moreover ... we are not going to fact check each of the emails that were stolen, hacked by Russian lead efforts in an effort to hurt our campaign.\" The statement ends with the leaders asking that Clinton immediately apologize for the comments of her aides. \"The WikiLeaks emails reveal a contempt for all traditional Christians, and we are -- Catholic and Evangelical -- united in our outrage and united in our call for Mrs. Clinton to immediately apologize for the Christophobic behavior of her associates,\" the statement said.\n",
      "                             This has to be one of the least convincing scandals. During the four years that Hillary Clinton was secretary of state she used (brace yourselves) a personal email account! Perhaps she thought this was a way of ensuring that Barack Obama didn't read her emails. Either way, Republican attempts to turn this into Hillary's Roswell fall short of the mark. On a scale of one to Watergate, I'd give this three. It is true that by using a commercial account, Clinton opened herself up to being hacked. It is also true that the rules of the National Archives and Records Administration stipulate that personal emails should only be used in \"emergency situations\" -- and as a historian I recognize the need for transparency and for keeping a record of everything written and sent for the appreciation of future generations.  And we'll recall, by the way, that officials in George W. Bush's administration did something like this -- using nonofficial email accounts for official business -- and were hounded by the Democrats for it. But whenever Clinton pinged an email to an official government account, then the conversation would still have been archived, and her office insists that emails from her personal account were handed over anyway. The suggestion that she thought she might have \"something to hide\" would only make sense if she had used her personal account on some occasions but not others.  She would have to have been blessed with the gift of clairvoyance to know back in 2009 that there would some day be controversy surrounding her handling of a siege of a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya -- and that it might be best to use personal email so as to cover her tracks in the future. Clinton may be many things, but the Republicans have yet to throw the witchcraft charge. Jeb Bush is angry about Clinton's email farrago and has tweeted that transparency matters. He is keen that we should know that he has a website that documents all the email exchanges that he had as governor of Florida. Why on God's Earth he's chosen to construct this archive, I can't imagine. It's the kind of grand gesture that politicians imagine the voters will be swayed by but actually leaves us thinking, \"Don't you have better things to do than this?\" Or else wondering if there's been some careful selecting of the emails to put the former governor in a good light.  Oh, there are some critical communications in the Jeb Bush archives. But I'm suspicious that he appears never once to have been contacted by a Nigerian prince to say that he has $12 million that he's trying to transfer out of the country or by a Russian lady looking for a husband. Perhaps such conversations took place through Bush's personal account -- in which case, we need to know what he said in reply. Of course there is a serious context to all of this: the Benghazi hearings. There is still much that the public has yet to be told, and Clinton's emails may well be critical to discerning the truth. But there is a far less serious context to \"email-gate,\" too: the presidential election. Literally every small slip that Clinton has ever made is obviously going to be turned into a huge thing -- including such breaches of office etiquette as using the wrong email account. Sources also told me that she sometimes puts her feet up on the desk and may have used the office phone for personal calls. Wicked, wicked woman. Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.

      "                             The Black Eyed Peas' \"I Gotta Feeling\" began to play -- Bill Clinton's cue to get off the stage.  But the former president, addressing a gathering of the Asian American Journalists Association here at the Caesar's Palace hotel, wouldn't budge, insisting over the music that he wanted to take one more question.  \"Let me answer it real quick and I'll go,\" Clinton said. \"They want me to go, I would stay.\" The questioner identified himself as a Democrat who loved Clinton as president and is supporting his wife, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election. But, he wanted to know: Why should Americans trust the Democratic nominee when she lied about her emails? \"Wait a minute,\" Bill Clinton said. \"It's not true.\" And so began the ex-president's unexpected fiery defense of one of the biggest controversies dogging Hillary Clinton's White House bid.  \"First of all, the FBI director said when he testified before Congress, he had to amend his previous day's statement that she had never received any emails that are classified. They saw two little notes with a 'C' on it,\" Clinton said. \"This is the biggest load of bull I've ever heard.\" Clinton went on to say that while the classification system of sensitive emails was \"too complicated to explain to people,\" what is clear is that Clinton and her colleagues were never being careless with national security.   \"Do you really believe there are 300 career diplomats because that's how many people were on these emails, all of whom were careless with national security? Do you believe that?\" he said. \"Forget about Hillary, forget about her. Is that conceivable?\" On Martha's Vineyard, hope for another Clinton era Clinton pointed to the number of prominent Republican leaders -- particularly those in the national security arena -- who have endorsed Clinton in recent weeks, as a sign that she is the only person fit to run the country.  \"There are people who spent their lifetimes advancing national security who believe she's the only person that you can trust,\" Clinton said.  The former secretary of state's use of a private email server at the State Department has complicated her campaign, particularly as she continues to battle questions from voters about her trustworthiness and honesty.  The FBI concluded this summer that it would not recommend charges against Clinton over the emails. But the agency's director, James Comey, said while he had no basis to believe Hillary Clinton had lied to the agency, she had been \"extremely careless\" in her use of the private email server.  Clinton set off a political firestorm recently when she insisted that Comey had said her answers to the American public regarding the emails were truthful.   She sought to clarify those remarks at a gathering of Hispanic and African-American journalists in Washington, D.C., last week, saying she may have \"short-circuited\" her answers. That acknowledgment set off Republicans and critics, including her GOP opponent, Donald Trump.  \"Director Comey had said that my answers in my FBI interview were truthful. That really is the bottom line here,\" she said last week. \"And I have said during the interview and in many other occasions over the past months that what I told the FBI, which he said was truthful, is consistent with what I have said publicly. I may have short-circuited and for what I will try to clarify.\"\n",
      "                             The State Department on Friday released approximately 1,500 pages of Hillary Clinton's official emails, but the team reviewing those emails won't get much time to rest. They still have about 4,000 pages to sort through by close of business on Monday, a date that will mark the end of a nine-month review process that has strained the State Department's resources and nagged Clinton's presidential campaign. A State Department staffer confirmed to CNN that personnel will be working throughout to weekend to prepare the final emails for release in an effort to meet the court-ordered deadline. \"We take our obligations to the court seriously and are making every effort to comply with this order,\" Deputy State Department Spokesman Mark Toner said ahead of Friday's release. \"We do intend, in that spirit, to make a final production on Monday, February 29th.\" The number of classification upgrades rises To date, the State Department has released more than 48,000 pages of Clinton's emails, representing 92.5% of the total set. Friday's batch included 88 emails that were retroactively upgraded to classified and redacted accordingly, bringing the total number of upgraded emails to 1,840. Clinton and officials at the State Department have long said none of the information was marked as classified at the time it was sent, but that hasn't prevented her critics from accusing her of mishandling information. The State Department is conducting a separate review into whether any information in the emails was classified at the time they were sent, but has provided no information on the timeline for that review. A controversy that won't end The email issue has plagued Clinton's presidential campaign since last March, when a New York Times report revealed she had used a private email server to conduct official business while in office and did not provide copies to the government for archiving purposes until she asked by State Department nearly two years after her tenure ended. At that time, Clinton's attorneys and staffers sorted through the emails, turning approximately 55,000 pages over to the State Department and withholding others they deemed personal. When news of her unusual email setup emerged, Clinton called on the State Department to release the emails. But while the release is nearing its conclusion, the questions that have dogged Clinton over the past year are unlikely to end so soon. That's because the FBI is currently investigating her server, and dozens of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits related to the email issue are plodding through the federal court system. At a hearing this week in one such case, a judge suggested he might call on the State Department to subpoena Clinton and one of her top aides for the personal emails her staff withheld. A drain on resources The State Department has devoted tremendous resources over the past year to its FOIA office to deal with this and other archiving and transparency issues. At a hearing Thursday on the Department's 2017 fiscal year budget proposal, current Secretary of State John Kerry lamented the drain. \"I've had to cannibalize bureaus -- young, capable lawyers, professionals -- to come out and go sit and work on this so we are able to meet the demands,\" Kerry said. \"We are overburdened.\" And Kerry hasn't been immune to the controversy over Clinton's email use. In that same hearing, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, hit the secretary with a barrage of questions on Clinton and on his own communication methods. \"You're fixated on this,\" said a clearly exasperated Kerry. \"I think people are really getting bored with it, congressman.\" State Department officials say that, unlike Clinton, Kerry uses a state.gov email address for official communications, and that a staffer periodically reviews his personal account to make sure everything official is being archived. But even as government agencies, the court system and politicians spar over proper use of email, new questions are arising over how government archiving rules can keep pace with fast-changing technology, as evidenced by another exchange at Thursday's hearing, during which Issa questioned Kerry on his texting habits. Kerry, who says he texts on occasion but only about logistics and never policy, emphasized that the State Department is currently undergoing a broad review of its archiving practices -- one that was, appropriately enough, instigated by the Clinton email revelation.\n",
      "                             FBI Director James Comey on Sunday issued a third highly unusual statement regarding the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, returning to the original theme of exoneration first proffered in July. Democrats breathed a sigh of relief. But how did we get here? And can Team Clinton really relax? The sorry history of the email saga leads directly back to the tarmac of Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport on June 27, 2016, when Bill Clinton decided to pay a surprise visit to his old friend Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The runway visit was by all accounts staggeringly improper. Lynch was then the chief law enforcement official in charge of an investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server.  According to Lynch, she and the former president only discussed \"grandchildren and golf.\" To her credit, the attorney general immediately recognized that the Clinton visit to her plane was an ethical and public relations disaster. She quite sensibly opted to distance herself from the decision-making with respect to the Hillary Clinton investigation. However, in a strange move, she ceded supervisory and decision-making responsibility concerning the email investigation directly to the FBI (a move she suggested had already been planned). In Washington's chain of command, the Justice Department exercises supervisory responsibility over the FBI. It is the Justice Department, not the FBI, that customarily makes the final decision regarding the commencement or termination of a criminal prosecution based upon the evidence gathered by the FBI. Yet while this was an extraordinary and unusual transfer of power from the Justice Department to its federal police arm, the FBI, Lynch had substantial reason to respect the integrity and judgment of Comey. After all, he had previously served as the United States attorney for New York's Southern District and as deputy attorney general of the United States from 2003-2005.  Given his sterling credentials, it is astonishing that Comey would later violate Justice Department protocols by making a number of public statements on the ongoing investigation. Comey asserted that he was protecting the FBI's reputation for straight shooting and integrity, but this attempt at \"transparency\" and \"openness\" has been a disaster.  Comey first issued a surprise announcement in July firmly suggesting Clinton's exoneration, prompting Trump and his supporters to cry foul and suggest the process was \"rigged\" in favor of Clinton. Democrats praised Comey's fairness and integrity.  Those accolades turned to dust when, on October 28, Comey announced the discovery of what later would be revealed to be perhaps tens of thousands of emails potentially relevant to the investigation. Enter former congressman and serial sexter Anthony Weiner, aka \"Carlos Danger,\" the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The FBI sent a letter to Congress saying that in a separate investigation of Weiner it had discovered the emails on a device the couple shared, a decision by Comey that elicited howls of protest from Democrats. But one more bizarre development remained. Just two days before the presidential election, Comey made unusual public announcement number three, stating that his hardworking agents had somehow (dare I say miraculously?) examined the new material and found nothing to change its view that Hillary Clinton should not face criminal charges.  The FBI must have quite an algorithm to conclude this review so swiftly. Regardless, as the election proceeds Tuesday, American voters will undoubtedly be shaking their heads about the whole sorry mess they have witnessed. And they have good reason to do so; the FBI's public announcements regarding the results of an incomplete investigation interfered in the campaign by first suggesting the exoneration of Clinton, then hinting at possible concerns, then clearing her again.  Responsible prosecutors wait until an investigation is over and/or the statute of limitations has run before issuing public pronouncements. New evidence often changes the course of an investigation, sometimes leading to the exoneration, sometimes leading to incarceration. When prosecutors truly seek justice, rather than headlines, silence is almost always the best policy while investigators gather the facts. And the reality is that the Hillary Clinton email story is far from over. The FBI initially failed to examine such an obvious source of relevant information as Anthony Weiner's computer. With that in mind, how many other devices are unexamined? Huma Abedin was reportedly surprised that  relevant emails were discovered on Weiner's computer. But Huma married a congressman who at one point was the front-runner in the New York mayoral race. I think it is safe to assume that this political couple would exchange emails about politics! So, if the FBI couldn't figure out that basic connection, it raises the question of how many other gaps exist in the probe. All this suggests a turbulent post-election period with calls for impeachment of whomever is elected. Whether a president can be impeached for \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" committed prior to an election is an interesting legal question that undoubtedly will be the subject of future debate and discussion. And there is also the question of whether a president can pardon her or himself. Plus, it is still unclear whether the FBI sees the Clinton investigation as finished, or more likely has just pushed the pause button.  Finally, this is not just about Clinton -- if Abedin doubts potential legal peril, she need only look at what happened to Chris Christie's former aides in the Bridgegate scandal. The jury has just handed down convictions while Christie has continued to work unscathed for Team Trump. A coverup and lying to the FBI are often the crimes that survive when evidence of all else shrivels on the vine.   In short, whoever wins Tuesday, one thing should be clear -- those who think our long national misery will finally be over with the election of a new president need to think again.\n",
      "                             A federal judge paved the way Tuesday for possible future subpoenas by the State Department against Hillary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin. Judge Emmet Sullivan granted a motion in a lawsuit against the State Department Tuesday that could pave the way for future action including, potentially, an order that the State Department subpoena Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin to obtain personal emails they withheld from the State Department. The case is seeking answers to lingering questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Sullivan appeared at times to be leaning towards ordering the subpoenas, but ultimately said he would wait to see what the order for discovery yields before making that ruling. \"This is the atypical case,\" Sullivan said, who emphasized earlier in the hearing that discovery is rare in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) cases, which pertain to information requests to the government. On Tuesday, the judge ruled that discovery was warranted in this case because Clinton's exclusive use of a private email server to conduct official business was condoned by the State Department, which tacitly allowed her keep those records when she left office. Judicial Watch, a conservative group that filed the lawsuit, must now submit a discovery plan to the court within three weeks, after which the State Department will have three weeks to respond. In a statement after the hearing, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said they would seek testimony from current and former State Department officials as part of their discovery plan. \"While Mrs. Clinton's testimony may not be required initially, it may happen that her testimony is necessary for the court to resolve the legal issues about her unprecedented email practices,\" Fitton said. Clinton's use of the server was first revealed by a New York Times report last March, two years after she left office, and a few months after the State Department asked her to return any official emails. Abedin, who was Clinton's deputy chief of staff at the State Department and is now a top official on her presidential campaign, also used an email account on the private clintonemail.com server. This particular case -- one of a number filed by conservative groups about Clinton's time as secretary of state --was originally filed by the private watchdog group Judicial Watch in 2013 over a document request related to Abedin was allowed her to simultaneously work for a foundation run by the Clintons and a private firm, while still consulting with the State Department. It was settled shortly after by the parties, but revived amid the revelation of Clinton and Abedin's email practices, which prevented the bulk of their emails from being searched for responsive records by State Department FOIA personnel. The issue of whether State should seek the emails Clinton's team determined to be personal is \"an issue worthy of discussion at the appropriate time,\" Sullivan said, bemoaning at one point the resources that have been spent by all parties as a result of Clinton's decision to use a personal email server. \"It just boggles the mind a little that the State Department allowed this practice to occur in the first place,\" said Sullivan. \"It is very, very troubling.\" Sullivan said he would \"give (the subpoena issue) some thought,\" and hopes the State Department's response, due in April, will put the court in a better position to determine whether the State Department has taken adequate steps to obtain an search official records. Last year, Sullivan ordered the State Department to seek declarations from Clinton and Abedin asserting they had turned over relevant documents, and asked the State Department to coordinate with the FBI, which now has possession of the email server, in finding other potentially relevant records. Clinton, Abedin and the FBI are not party to the lawsuit, so Sullivan could not issue orders to them directly. Sullivan said he was pleased with the State Department's compliance on these steps, but said questions remain as to why the private system was set up in the first place, and whether it was, as Judicial Watch asserts, an attempt to thwart the FOIA process. \"This is a public forum,\" said Sullivan. \"This is about the public's right to know.\" Steven Myers, an attorney for the State Department, argued at Tuesday's hearing that the agency has already conducted a reasonable search for records, having obtained nearly 55,000 pages of official emails from Clinton, which they are releasing to the public under a time line set in a separate FOIA case. Furthermore, Myers argued, the State Department should not be expected to search records they don't physically possess. It is unclear whether Clinton and Abedin's attorneys still have copies of the emails in question, having turned the server's contents over to the FBI last year. The FBI is conducting its own investigation into the set-up of the server. \n",
      "                             The FBI expects to publicly release in the coming days the report the bureau sent to the Justice Department in July recommending no charges in the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, according to multiple law enforcement officials.   The release is in response to numerous FOIA requests including from CNN.   Also to be released is Hillary Clinton's 302, the FBI agent notes from Clinton's voluntary interview at FBI headquarters. The report is about 30 pages, and the 302 is about a dozen pages according to the officials.  Not yet being released are additional notes from interviews of Clinton aides or other investigative materials that were sent to Congress.  Last month, FBI Director James Comey recommended against charges for Clinton for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, but he did describe her behavior as \"extremely careless\" with classified material.  RELATED: FBI boss Comey's 7 most damning lines on Clinton State may have found new Benghazi docs from Clinton server The State Department on Tuesday announced it may have uncovered additional documents related to the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, among those turned over by the FBI. A spokesman for the department noted that the approximately 30 documents in question are still being examined and may include duplicates of the emails already turned over by Clinton's staff and released to the public.  \"Using broad search terms, we have identified approximately 30 documents potentially responsive to a Benghazi-related request,\" spokesman John Kirby said in a statement to CNN. \"At this time, we have not confirmed that the documents are, in fact, responsive, or whether they are duplicates of materials already provided to the Department by former Secretary Clinton in December 2014.\"    The department is assessing 14,900 documents it received from the FBI as part of the investigation into Clinton's use of her private email server while she was secretary of state. Donald Trump's campaign suggested the emails are a sign Clinton deleted work-related material. \"Hillary Clinton swore before a federal court and told the American people she handed over all of her work-related emails,\" Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser for the Trump campaign, wrote. \"If Clinton did not consider emails about something as important as Benghazi to be work-related, one has to wonder what is contained in the other emails she attempted to wipe from her server.\" The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond for comment. This story has been updated to reflect the latest reporting.\n",
      "                             Donald Trump on Tuesday accused the Justice Department of feeding information to Hillary Clinton's campaign to \"cover up for her crimes.\" Trump seized on hacked emails released by Wikileaks that purport to show Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon communicating with the DOJ regarding a FOIA lawsuit in 2015, and said they showed collusion between Clinton and the Obama administration regarding its email investigation. \"The DOJ fed information to the Clinton campaign about the email investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up for her crimes,\" Trump said, at a rally in Panama City, in Florida's deeply conservative panhandle. \"This is collusion and corruption of the highest order and is one more reason I will ask my attorney general ... to appoint a special prosecutor.\" \"We have to investigate Hillary Clinton and we have to investigate the investigation. This was a disgrace,\" Trump said, referring to the FBI probe into Clinton's private email server. The communication between Fallon and the DOJ, revealed by WikiLeaks, only concerned the FOIA lawsuit, and not the investigation into Clinton's email use. There is no evidence DOJ communicated with Fallon on other issues, including its email investigation. Trump hit Clinton right at the top of his speech, repeatedly citing information drawn from the emails hacked and given to Wikileaks, in a concentrated assault. \"You see so much from the Wikileaks, there is so much,\" Trump said.  The Republican nominee also seized on reports that State Department insiders gave priorities to friends of Bill Clinton when handling aid contracts following the deadly earthquake in Haiti in 2010. \"We should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time out. To all our friends in Haiti and Little Haiti, your day of justice is coming and it arrives on November 8,\" Trump said. In an email on May 19, 2015, Fallon advised of upcoming action in a civil lawsuit by Vice News reporter Jason Leopold that resulted in the State Department releasing tens of thousands of Clinton's emails. \"DOJ folks inform me there is a status hearing in this case this morning, so we could have a window into the judge's thinking about this proposed production schedule as quickly as today,\" Fallon, a former Justice Department spokesman, wrote. The hearing Fallon was referring to was publicly available information and covered extensively at the time by CNN, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, Politico, Vice, National Journal and The Hill, among others.  The exchange is included in the third batch of emails that appear to be hacked from Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta and posted by WikiLeaks. The Clinton campaign has never formally verified the authenticity of the emails, the first of which were released Friday. WikiLeaks claims to have 50,000 emails hacked from Podesta and has thus far released roughly 5,300.   In a tweet Tuesday afternoon, Trump wrote, \"I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks. She is unfit to run.\" He did not mention any specific allegation or hacked email or allegation. The most significant news from the emails posted came Friday, when WikiLeaks posted what appeared to be excerpts from transcripts of speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street companies after leaving the State Department.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday that he would not comment directly on \"stolen emails of a private citizen\" when questioned about an email showing the Clinton campaign was in touch with the Justice Department. \"I will say in general is both the attorney general and the FBI director have made clear the investigation of Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server was conducted without regard to partisan politics,\" Earnest said. The Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday on Fallon's email. But Fallon, in a string of tweets Monday night, accused WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange of coordinating the releases with the Russian government and the Trump campaign. \".@wikileaks You are no media organization. You are a propaganda arm of the Russian govt, running interference for their pet candidate, Trump,\" Fallon wrote. \n",
      "                             A group of Democratic senators are questioning whether investigations by two inspectors general offices into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server are impartial.  In a letter addressed to the Inspector General of National Intelligence Charles McCullough III and Inspector General of the Department of State Steve Linick, ranking members of the Senate Intelligence, Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs, and Judiciary committees expressed concerns that those involved in the review of the former secretary of state's emails are not considering the \"complexities or the interagency difference on each email into account,\" the letter read.  The senators asked the IGs \"perform your duties dispassionately and comprehensively\" and then requested that they respond to the lawmakers' questions by March 31. While pointing out that email reviews of the last five secretaries of state have taken place under the inspector general's office, the senators call the process of classifying emails \"complex\" and \"subjective\" and adding that its not \"normally within the purview of inspectors general,\" the letter said.  The concerns, according to the letter, are raised after a \"potential whistleblower\" from the State Department's inspector general office \"accused the office of having an anti-Clinton bias,\" as well as alleged inaccuracies in the classification of emails thought to have included classified information, which was later proved to be inaccurate.  The letter concluded by acknowledging how \"politicized\" the review has been and then sets forth a number of questions for the inspectors general to answer regarding information leaks to the media and their review process. \n",
      "                             The Senate judiciary committee sent a letter Friday to former Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking her to disclose any conversations with Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee about the FBI's investigation into the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee's use of a private email server. The committee asked Lynch about any conversations she had with Clinton staffer Amanda Renteria or former DNC Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz about the email investigation. The panel also asked for Renteria and Leonard Benardo and Gail Scovell of the Open Society Foundations to disclose about their conversations with the FBI and Lynch over the Clinton investigation. The Washington Post reported last month there was a document claiming that Schultz sent a letter to Bernado claiming Lynch had been in private communication with Renteria about the investigation claiming the she would not let the FBI investigation go too far. The document, however, was believed to be bad intelligence, according to the Post. The request for information from Lynch and the others is the judiciary committee's newest element of its investigation into political interference at the FBI, one that may also probe whether President Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice in his firing of former FBI Director Jim Comey. By requesting information from Lynch as well, the judiciary committee is expanding its probe on political interference to cover both the Obama and Trump administrations. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and top Democrat on the panel, Dianne Feinstein, reached an agreement this week on the scope of their investigation, which includes political interference as well as Russia's election meddling. Grassley and Feinstein -- as well as Sens. Lindsey Graham and Sheldon Whitehouse, who lead the subcommittee looking into Russia's meddling -- met with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday to discuss de-conflicting his probe with the Senate investigation. They said afterward they had a productive discussion to ensure the two investigations can proceed without impeding the other.\n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008 had a novel way to get under John McCain's skin during her first run at the White House: \"feminize\" him. The email was released Monday as part of the latest batch of John Podesta's emails that WikiLeaks posted online and follows a string of other embarrassing revelations from inside Clinton's 2008 and 2016 campaigns. Longtime Clinton ally, and now CNN contributor, Paul Begala wrote in a February 3, 2008 email to Podesta and other top aides that the campaign should air a spot tying then-Republican candidate John McCain to President George W. Bush, who was deeply unpopular at the time. Clinton was locked in a heated -- and ultimately losing -- battle for the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama, a fellow senator. \"'Happy Together' is, as you know, the spot I've fantasized about for two years. I love it. It feminizes McCain and ridicules him. Will generate buzz and perhaps piss the old sailor off. It certainly draws the link between McCain and Bush. I think it's sticky and memorable,\" Begala wrote.  Begala did not immediately return a CNN request for comment Monday. Begala, who is working this election as a top adviser to one of Clinton's super PACs previously detailed McCain's literal and figurative embrace of Bush in his book released just before the 2008 general election. The Clinton campaign has not commented or verified the authenticity of the emails. One of the most damning volleys was the release of transcripts from Clinton's speeches to bankers which she tried to keep private through this election. \n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton's personal email set-up caused extensive troubles inside the State Department, including her own messages to top staffers getting lost in spam filters, according to a new deposition of top aide Huma Abedin.  \"We should talk about putting you on State e-mail or releasing your e-mail address to the department so you are not going to spam,\" Abedin wrote in a Nov. 13, 2010 email to Clinton that was discussed in a deposition Tuesday with Judicial Watch.  Abedin, who has become ensnared in ongoing Clinton email probes, explained in the deposition -- a transcript of which was released Wednesday afternoon -- that Clinton had missed an important call with a foreign minister because emails from her personal account were being filtered out.  \"Her initial e-mail was about a phone call with a ... foreign minister, which she missed and missed the call because she never got the -- I never got her e-mail suggests -- giving us the signoff to do it. So she wasn't able to do her job, do what she needed to do,\" Abedin said. \"Just reading the exchange, she seems frustrated because she's not able to do her job.\" The deposition, released as part of an ongoing lawsuit from the conservative watchdog group, also includes talk of other internal communication breakdowns spurred by Clinton's use of a personal email server to send emails while she was secretary of state.  But Abedin, long one of Clinton's closest confidants, defended repeatedly against arguments the former secretary of state had done anything wrong.  \"Let's get separate address or device but I don't want any risk of the personal being accessible,\" Clinton wrote in reply to Abedin's Nov. 13, 2010 suggestion that she use a government email account. Abedin was peppered with questions about Clinton's, but she repeatedly said it was Clinton protecting her personal emails from being read -- and not about hiding government communications.  \"Just like you wouldn't -- I would imagine anybody who has personal e-mail doesn't want that personal e-mail to be read by anybody else... I read it the same way as she has written it,\" Abedin said.  A State Department spokeswoman declined comment on the problems raised in the deposition, citing ongoing litigation.  Throughout her deposition, Abedin defended Clinton's decisions, describing them as normal and not suspect at all. \"She had requested a secure BlackBerry, but that did not come to fruition,\" Abedin said, noting that her use of a personal BlackBerry was not surprising. \"I experienced it as continuing the practice that she had had prior to arriving at the State Department, and continuing to use her personal device.\"\n",
      "                             Donald Trump said Wednesday that Hillary Clinton \"has to go to jail\" because the scandal over her email server, comments that mark a major departure from the American political tradition. The GOP nominee, firing up a large crowd of loyal supporters during a swing through Florida, also laid into the Democratic nominee over her health and seized on disclosures from hacked emails of her campaign chairman, John Podesta, released by Wikileaks. The broadsides came as Trump sought to get the focus back on his presidential rival, following a slump in his poll numbers triggered by his latest debate performance along with lewd and sexually aggressive remarks on a 2005 video that surfaced last week. At a morning rally in Ocala, Trump said that he was \"embarrassed\" Congress had not done more to probe Clinton after the FBI decided not to seek charges against her over the private email server she used as secretary of state. \"Do they make deals like this?\" Trump asked. \"This is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I've ever seen involving justice in the United States ? in the history of the United States.\" \"We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency.\" RELATED: Poll finds Clinton and Trump tied in Utah as a potential spoiler surges Later on, after moving on to Lakeland, Florida, Trump again renewed his vow to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton if he is elected. Clinton \"has to go to jail,\" Trump warned, adding that the lawyers working for her over the email issue should also be incarcerated. Trump also took a fresh shot at Clinton's health, saying that she would not, like him, be able to stand and deliver a raucous speech for an hour in a boiling hot livestock shed that was hosting his rally. \"Let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk, and let's see how long she lasts, folks,\" Trump said. \"What a joke.\"  The Republican nominee also argued that emails released by Wikileaks showed Clinton had been \"viciously attacking Catholics and evangelicals.\"  \"That won't be tolerated. Anybody of religion, I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you,\" he said. RELATED: As Trump gets 'unshackled,' Clinton's campaign sweats turnout Trump was apparently referencing a 2011 email between John Podesta, the subject of the Wikileaks hack and Clinton's campaign chairman, communications director Jennifer Palmieri and John Halpin, a senior fellow at the liberal think-tank Center for American Progress. In the email, Halpin writes that 21st Century Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch and News Corp Chairman Robert Thomson, who are both Catholic, are attracted to the faith because of \"systemic thought and severely backward gender relations.\" Palmieri responded, \"I imagine they think it the is the most socially acceptable, politically conservative religion -- their rich friends wouldn't understand if they became evangelical.\" Palmieri told reporters Wednesday that she \"didn't recognize (the email) but moreover... we are not going to fact check each of the emails that were stolen, hacked by (Russia) ... in an effort to hurt our campaign.\"\n",
      "                             Breaking the rules. Finding a route. Going to court. It's Thursday, and here are the 5 things you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.  1. Campaign 2016 The hits just keep on coming for Hillary Clinton's campaign. Yesterday the State Department Inspector General hit her hard in the report on her email usage: Clinton broke the rules and failed to inform key State Department staff on her use of a private email server. And at the very least, Hillz should have surrendered all State Department emails before leaving office, the report says. Clinton's surrogates were out screaming \"move along, nothing to see here,\" but Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are going to have a field day with this.     2. ISIS ISIS is determined to get deeper into Europe, one way or the other. Sending terrorists through the migrant routes from Turkey to Greece is becoming too hard, so ISIS is now actively working to smuggle its folks into Europe via a Mediterranean Sea route that starts in the failed state of Libya, where ISIS has gained a toehold. A Libyan official told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh that ISIS militants disguise themselves by traveling with families and without weapons.  3. Missing journalists If you needed a reminder that some countries are just straight up dangerous for journalists, take a look at Colombia. Three journalists have vanished there in a few days, and government troops are scouring Colombia's northern region trying to find them. Spanish journalist Salud Hernandez went missing while working on a story in the remote region known for heavy guerrilla presence and organized crime.

      "                             The FBI released Friday nearly 200 pages of notes from its investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server, just three days before she squares off against Donald Trump in the first presidential debate. The notes, taken from interviews of top Clinton aides, supporters and others, include details of how a close Clinton confidant explained how the State Department made sure the White House system would not bounce back the emails from the then-secretary of state.  But the documents -- a summary of which had already been released in the overall FBI report -- provide little in the way of major bombshells. Politically, however, Friday's release helps keep the issue relevant before the debate. The release also comes hours after news that top Clinton aide Cheryl Mills had obtained a limited immunity deal from the FBI in order to cooperate with its investigation. In one exchange, an unidentified interviewee details alleged efforts by a top State Department official, Patrick Kennedy, to argue during the release of the Clinton emails for classifications that would protect her. But Kennedy, in his own interview, denied the charge. Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, in her interview, explained how they had to update email addresses with the White House so Clinton could email President Barack Obama because the President could only receive emails from approved addresses. If her email was not on an approved list, which was managed by the President's staff, the White House server would reject it. When Abedin was shown a 2012 email exchange, she did not recognize the pseudonym -- when agents explained it was Obama, she replied, \"How is this not classified?\" There is no evidence Obama knew that Clinton was using a private email server at the time. He has said he only found out about her use of it when it became public. Many of those who communicated with Clinton have told the FBI they didn't realize she was using a private server, and often one may not realize what email address is behind a name unless one clicks on it. Agents also interviewed \"Guccifer\" -- the hacker who targeted the Bush family -- who detailed his successful infiltration of close Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal's email account and reviewed 30,000 emails and downloaded 25 attachments. Guccifer also detailed taking a screenshot of one Blumenthal exchange regarding the Benghazi attacks. FBI releases Hillary Clinton email report In other interviews released Friday evening, Clinton aides seemed generally unconcerned about her use of a private email server and said she adhered to standard security measures -- arguments they have made extensively in public. But one IT worker took a somewhat cavalier attitude, joking in one interview that a new 60-day retention policy was a \"Hillary coverup operation\" -- which sparked the Trump campaign's anger. \"The fact an IT staffer maintaining Clinton's secret server called a new retention policy designed to delete emails after 60 days a 'Hillary coverup operation' suggests there was a concerted effort to systematically destroy potentially incriminating information,\" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. \"It's no wonder that at least five individuals tied to the email scandal, including Clinton's top State Department aide and attorney Cheryl Mills, secured immunity deals from the Obama Justice Department to avoid prosecution.\"  The latest revelations in the Clinton email scandal are certain to play a central role in Trump's line of attack Monday, when the two meet for their first presidential debate in New York. Trump has built his \"Crooked Hillary\" line of insults off arguments stemming from her emails. The additional notes were released three weeks after the FBI released its report from its investigation of Clinton and her emails, as well as the notes from Clinton's own high-profile interview with federal agents.  Clinton, in her interview, said she did not know about key records retention policies and whether she was violating rules. But on the trail, her campaign and supporters have routinely said she did not break any laws with her email handling. No criminal charges FBI Director James Comey in July took the unprecedented step of announcing in a press conference the FBI's conclusion that there was not enough evidence to merit a criminal prosecution, before handing over his findings to the Justice Department. The DOJ followed that recommendation and decided no prosecution was merited. After Comey testified about the decision before Congress, members requested access to his agency's report. Last month, the bureau gave members of Congress access to the notes, as well as notes from interviews with other Clinton staff and aides, but kept that version of the report classified. Comey testified that no transcript of the interview exists, only the notes taken on it. Clinton was not under oath.\n",
      "                             FBI Director James Comey said Tuesday he does not see a need for urgency in completing the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. But he did say that he is staying \"close to this one to make sure we have the resources to do it competently,\" the Niagara-Gazette reported Tuesday. Comey, in a visit to the FBI's Buffalo, New York, field office, said it's the agency's priority to complete the investigation \"well and promptly\" but that \"well\" comes first. Sources have previously told CNN that the investigation has entered its final stages.  When asked by reporters whether he felt any pressure to wrap up the investigation prior to the Democratic convention in July, Comey said no, CNN affiliate WIVB.com reported. \"The only reason I hesitate is in any investigation of intense public interest, whether it involved a public figure. Involves some horrific crime. San Bernardino is a great example. We feel a great sense of urgency to do it well and to do it promptly,\" Comey said. While the Clinton email server investigation has garnered substantially more attention that any other ongoing FBI investigation, Comey brushed away concerns over the political implications that could come from the investigations findings. \"I wouldn't say the concerns are any different in any of the high profile cases. And the reason is good people want to know. There's an intense interest in investigations like that,\" Comey said.\n",
      "                             Vice President-elect Mike Pence is embroiled in a legal challenge stemming from his decision to withhold information from a public records request in a case local Democrats say raises the specter of the Indiana governor shielding all of his emails from public view.  It's a bit ironic as Pence, along with running mate President-elect Donald Trump blasted their way into the White House in part by hammering away at Democrat Hillary Clinton's own email scandal. Pence's lawyers have argued, in part, that a state court decision protecting state lawmakers from releasing their own records should also apply to his office.  But Bill Groth, a Democratic lawyer fighting the Pence administration in state court, cautioned that if the court accepts their argument, it could shield all his communications from the public.  \"If the court buys their separation of powers argument, the executive branch will be exempt from (Indiana's public records law),\" Groth said. \"Why are they willing to take that risk if they have statutory arguments and they aren't really seeking to exempt the executive?\" In Clinton's case, her use of a private email server led to an FBI investigation that dogged her campaign but never amounted to a determination of wrong-doing. But the GOP ticket used it as an example of what they said was poor decision-making and worked to further voter distrust of her. \"The FBI last summer concluded that Hillary Clinton having classified documents on that private server was 'extremely careless,' \" Pence said just last week. \"And I guess today, I don't know if you heard, today they announced that they had not changed that conclusion.\" But a top Pence spokesman said that this current email case, which is being weighed in Indiana's Court of Appeals now, is nothing like Clinton's email scandal.  \"The plaintiff received the text of the email in one question. One email,\" said Pence deputy chief of staff Matt Lloyd. \"The court reviewed the white paper and determined the state was correct in protecting it as attorney client privilege.\" Lloyd added that Pence has never had a private email server and never destroyed any devices containing his emails.  Groth did receive the email he sought, about Pence's decision to have the state join a consortium of other states suing to block President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration. But he is fighting for access to the attachment to that email, an issue paper that Pence's lawyers argue is confidential under attorney-client privilege.  Indiana's public access counselor, a lawyer who independently reviews public access and transparency complaints, determined that Pence had complied with state law in the case and did not ding him on the issue. The same counselor, last year, blasted state lawmakers for shielding their communications from public view.  But public access advocates and journalists have put Trump on watch, after he blacklisted reporters -- something Pence said he fought against after joining the ticket. And Pence himself has had transparency woes, after he was forced to pull the plug on a proposed state-run news service last year.\n",
      "                             Bryan Pagliano, the former State Department staffer who helped set up Hillary Clinton's private email server, began his cooperation with the FBI and the Justice Department under an immunity deal late last year after initially rebuffing investigators, according to a U.S. law enforcement official.  The FBI has done at least one interview with him, and under the cooperation agreement, he may be asked to do more interviews, the official said.  While he has turned over documents to the FBI related to his management of the Clinton server, investigators sought to interview him because they believed he could shed light on the period during which the server was set up and any discussions with Clinton and her aides about the security for a system that would be storing sensitive government information, according to the official.  Clinton has said she set up the private system for convenience, in order to avoid carrying more than one mobile device to access government and private emails.  Pagliano's attorney would not comment to CNN. The probe into Clinton's use of a private email server while leading the State Department shifted into a new phase recently as investigators completed the review of the emails, working with intelligence agencies and the State Department to determine whether they were classified. Wednesday night, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton's presidential campaign, told CNN that the former secretary of state \"has been cooperating with the Justice Department's security inquiry, including offering in August to meet with them to assist their efforts if needed.\" Fallon added that the campaign was \"pleased\" Pagliano was cooperating with the Justice Department. Last fall, when Pagliano invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and declined to talk to congressional investigators, Fallon said: \"(Clinton has) encouraged everyone to cooperate because we want to make every good-faith effort to be transparent and answer any questions people have. With Mr. Pagliano, we encouraged him as well because we don't think he has any reason to not be transparent about the help that he provided from an IT perspective, but unfortunately, it is his choice what to do.\" With the completion of the email review, FBI investigators are expected to shift their focus on whether the highly sensitive government information, including top secret and other classified matters, found on Clinton's private email server constitutes a crime. RELATED: Clinton emails: What have we learned? The emails released publicly show some Clinton aides sent the sensitive information, often from the State Department's unclassified email system, to others, and eventually to Clinton at her private email address. She didn't use a State Department email account. The released emails appear to align with her public statements that she didn't send emails that were marked as classified. She did receive emails from aides that, while not marked as classified, did contain information that should not have been handled outside the government's secure email system, the emails released so far have found. The FBI reviewers oversaw the process that upgraded the emails now known to be highly sensitive as part of a series of State Department Freedom of Information Act releases that ended Monday. Clinton has said she hasn't been asked to be interviewed for the FBI probe. The Pagliano immunity agreement has caught the interest of Republicans on Capitol Hill. Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, chairmen, respectively, of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees, are requesting a copy of the immunity agreement.  \"The Committees believe that Mr. Pagliano possesses unique information about Secretary Clinton's private email account and server that is vital to the Committees' ongoing inquiries into this matter,\" the pair wrote in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton attempted to clarify Friday recent misleading statements about her use of a private email server at the State Department, saying she \"may have short-circuited\" her answers about it.  At a gathering of black and Hispanic journalists in Washington, D.C., Clinton -- who has come under fire for not often taking media questions -- was asked about her recent assertion that FBI Director James Comey had said she was \"truthful\" to the public in discussing the issue, a claim that a number of media outlets, including CNN, have debunked.  \"I was pointing out in both of those instances, that Director Comey had said that my answers in my FBI interview were truthful. That really is the bottom line here,\" she said. \"What I told the FBI, which he said was truthful, is consistent with what I have said publicly. I may have short-circuited and for that I will try to clarify.\"  Clinton went on to repeat that she \"never sent or received\" classified information on her private email server -- a statement that is inconsistent with Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill.  \"And I would go back to where I started, I regret using one account, I have taken responsibility for that,\" Clinton said. The email controversy has continued to dog Clinton's presidential campaign, particularly as she suffers from the widespread perception among voters that she isn't honest or trustworthy.  Clinton on Friday also called on journalists hold Donald Trump accountable, saying reporters \"have a special responsibility to our democracy at a time like this.\" She warned about her opponent: \"He's harkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society ... He retweets white nationalists.\" Clinton also addressed the problematic ways in which Trump has treated reporters, saying it is a \"badge of honor\" when journalists are kicked out of his press conferences or banned from attending his rallies.  \"America is better than Donald Trump,\" she said. \"We need to stand up and say that Donald Trump doesn't represent who we are and what we believe.\" Trump quickly pounced on Clinton's comments. His campaign Friday released a web video highlighting the controversy over Clinton's private email server, writing on Facebook that there is \"no doubt\" that Clinton \"is a pathological liar.\" And on Saturday, he tweeted, \"Anybody whose mind \"SHORT CIRCUITS\" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word \"BRAINWASHED.\"  Clinton touts economic progress At the core of Clinton's brief opening remarks at Friday's conference was the economic progress made under President Barack Obama's two terms in the White House. Clinton said Friday that the country was \"out of the ditch.\" Ex-CIA chief endorses Clinton, labels Trump 'threat to national security' \"I believe President Obama does not get the credit that he deserves for leading us out of the Great Recession,\" Clinton said. \"We are out of the ditch that we were in and now we've got to do even more. We've got to build on the progress that we've made.  The Democratic nominee for president noted minorities were especially hurt by the financial crisis.  \"It's been said that when the economy catches a cold, communities of color get pneumonia,\" she said. \"The great recession hit our whole country hard but the toll was especially difficult for black and Latino families.\" Clinton's comments came hours after the U.S. government announced that the economy added 255,000 jobs in July -- surpassing economists' expectations -- while the unemployment rate stayed at 4.9%.  Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, have been traveling the country to discuss their jobs agenda, including a three-day bus tour across the Rust Belt following the Democratic National Convention.  To counter the stronger-than-expected jobs report, Republican nominee Donald Trump released a statement Friday morning saying the country is \"in the middle of the single worst 'recovery' since the Great Depression\" \"The economy the media and the Clinton Machine is describing is an economy that doesn't exist for most Americans,\" Trump said. \"It's an economy enjoyed by her donors and special interests, and one suffered through every day by millions of Americans.\" Looming over Clinton's appearance in front of a ballroom full of journalists in Washington, D.C., was her relative lack of interactions with reporters.   Clinton has emerged one of the least accessible candidates to run for president this year, rarely taking question from her traveling press corps. Clinton last held a formal press conference on December 4, 2015, in Fort Dodge, Iowa. Since then she had held 11 \"gaggles\" -- or informal press conferences -- taking questions from a few members of her traveling press corps. The last such huddle was on July 31 in Ashland, Ohio. Rather than have frequent contact with reporters, Clinton's campaign has opted for sit-down interviews -- a setting that her aides believe she is more comfortable in.  Brian Fallon, her national press secretary, has routinely said that Clinton \"oftentimes\" will end the day with a media availability where she will \"literally stand there for 15, 20 minutes and answer questions from her traveling press corps, including the embeds from the various networks.\"  But Clinton has not once taken questions for 15 to 20 minutes in 2016. The growing frustration among reporters and the criticism about the lack of accessibility has irked some Clinton's campaign officials. \"We'll have a press conference when we want to have a press conference,\" Joel Benenson, Clinton's chief strategist, said last month. As Clinton took questions from reporters on Friday, Washington Post's Ed O'Keefe quipped: \"We encourage you to do this more often.\"\n",
      "                             Former Defense Secretary Bob Gates told Yahoo News' Katie Couric on Thursday that he questions Hillary Clinton's judgment in using a private email server while serving as secretary of state. \"There are obviously a lot of questions about her judgment and her policy positions subsequent to when I left\" the cabinet, he said. \"There's the whole email thing, which I think is really a concern in terms of her judgment.\" Pressed on the matter, Gates added, \"I don't know what originally prompted her to think that was a good idea.\" \"I never used email for official business, either as CIA director or secretary of defense,\" he continued. \"... And so using an offline server, I think, was an error in judgment.\" CNN has reached out to the Clinton campaign for response.  Gates also said his views began to diverge with Clinton's over U.S. involvement in Libya in 2011, but that his opinion of her overall is a \"mixed picture.\" Earlier this month, Gates told ABC's Martha Raddatz there is an over-classification problem in government, seemingly backing Clinton's position on the matter. Gates became defense secretary under then-President George W. Bush in 2006 but continued his position during Obama's first term until 2011, where he overlapped with Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.\n",
      "                             A former State Department IT staffer who was involved in setting up and servicing Hillary Clinton's private email server refused to answer questions from a second congressional committee Tuesday, sparking anger among Republican committee members.  Bryan Pagliano, who worked for the State Department during Clinton's tenure but was also paid separately by the Clinton family to manage the private email server she used while in office, did not appear at the hearing before the House Oversight Committee despite receiving a subpoena to appear late last week. The no-transparency election \"I will consult with counsel and my colleagues on the committee to consider a full range of options available to address Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear,\" committee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz said, later noting, \"when you are served a subpoena from the United States Congress, it is not optional.\" Pagliano previously plead the Fifth in a closed-door session with the House Select Committee on Benghazi last year. Subsequently, Pagliano was granted limited immunity by the Department of Justice to be interviewed by the FBI. Pagliano also declined to answer questions when subpoenaed in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch. In letters to Chaffetz sent ahead of Tuesday's hearing, Pagaliano's attorney, Mark MacDougall, argued that his office was not given sufficient time to respond to the subpoena, and asserted that any call to have Pagliano appear on Capitol Hill a second time to plead the Fifth, \"furthers no legislative purpose and is a transparent effort to publicly harass and humiliate our client for unvarnished political purpose.\" The Clinton campaign in the past has encouraged everyone involved with the server to cooperate and answer questions, including Pagliano. Donald Trump's campaign seized on the development.  \"The fact that the individuals who maintained Hillary Clinton's secret email server pleaded the Fifth shows once again why she can't be trusted in the White House,\" spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement. Clinton didn't think illness was 'going to be that big a deal' Two other witnesses at Tuesday's hearing appeared before the committee but also invoked their Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions.   Those witnesses, Paul Combetta and Bill Thornton, worked for Platte River Networks, a company hired by the Clinton family to maintain the server. A fourth witness -- a former aide to former President Bill Clinton -- stayed to answer questions.\n",
      "                             A top official at the State Department repeatedly sought to have the FBI back down on classifying the contents of an email from Hillary Clinton's private email server, documents released Monday revealed.  According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton's email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling \"pressured\" by another FBI official at Kennedy's request. The FBI is denying that any \"quid pro quo\" was offered in the fight between the bureau and State Department over the classification level of the email, though one interview described it as such.   \"Not only is there no proof. It's absolutely not true, a completely false allegation. It just didn't happen that way,\" John Kirby, State Department spokesman told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day\" Tuesday. \"There was no bargain sought by the FBI. There was no bargain rendered. This was simply an inner agency conversation about the classification over one particular email. So there was no wrongdoing here.\" At issue are somewhat contradictory interview notes contained in the crop of newly released FBI documents. In one, an FBI official recounted hearing second-hand that the State Department had offered a \"quid pro quo\" in exchange for declassifying an email. In another, a different FBI official said he told State Department he'd look into the email, if State Department looked into his request for personnel in Iraq.  An FBI records management official told the FBI in one interview that a member of the International Operations Division (IOD) told him that Kennedy had reached out to have an email unclassified in exchange for a \"quid pro quo,\" according to the records management official, documents revealed Monday show. The records management official said the IOD official \"pressured\" him to change the email's classification.  In return for FBI declassifying one of the Clinton server emails, the interviewee said as relayed by the IOD official, the State Department official offered to help station FBI agents overseas in sensitive areas. The anonymous individual said in a later meeting at State with several intelligence agencies, Kennedy responded to a question about whether any emails were classified by making eye contact and saying, \"well, we'll see.\"  After the meeting, the individual said, \"Kennedy spent the next 15 minutes debating the classification for he email and attempting to influence the FBI to change its markings.\" That records management official concluded State had an \"agenda\" related to \"minimizing\" the classification issues with Clinton's emails.   The newly released documents contain a summary of interview notes related to the FBI's investigation into whether classified information was improperly handled while Clinton was secretary of state.  But another interview contained in the same collection said that though Kennedy reached out to FBI about declassifying the email, it was the FBI that brought up getting agents stationed in Iraq.  That FBI employee said he personally spoke with Kennedy about the email, and that he suggested he would \"look into the email matter\" if Kennedy \"would provide authority concerning the FBI's request to increase its personnel in Iraq.\" In a follow-up, however, that FBI employee was told the email would remain classified, and relayed that to Kennedy. According to the interviews, Kennedy tried several times to get the FBI to declassify the email.  The dispute was over an email that State determined to be unclassified, but in inter-agency review, the FBI said contained classified information.  State said the email was released, with redactions, in May 2015 as part of its Freedom of Information Act disclosure. The email, from November 18, 2012, was about possible arrests related to the Benghazi attacks. Later in the FBI documents was an interview with an employee of the State Department inspector general, who said Kennedy was \"not positive\" in his interactions with the inspector general. \"Some FOIA officials have seen events and behaviors they did not like or that made them uncomfortable, to include Kennedy's attitude towards them and how they handled the FOIA process related to Clinton,\" the interview notes said.  Both FBI and State on Monday denied any \"quid pro quo.\" \"The FBI determined that one such email was classified at the Secret level,\" FBI said Monday in a statement. \"A senior State Department official requested the FBI re-review that email to determine whether it was in fact classified or whether it might be protected from release under a different FOIA exemption. A now-retired FBI official, who was not part of the subsequent Clinton investigation, told the State Department official that they would look into the matter. Having been previously unsuccessful in attempts to speak with the senior State official, during the same conversation, the FBI official asked the State Department official if they would address a pending, unaddressed FBI request for space for additional FBI employees assigned abroad.\"   The FBI maintained the email should remain classified.  Trump calls for government ethics reforms State Department Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner called allegations of a quid pro quo \"inaccurate\" and said Monday that Kennedy was trying to \"understand\" the FBI's decision to withhold the information.   \"Classification is an art, not a science, and individuals with classification authority sometimes have different views,\" Toner said. \"There can be applicable FOIA exemptions that are based on both classified and unclassified rules. ... We have been committed to releasing as much information to the public as possible, and ensuring that documents are withheld due to classification only when necessary to prevent damage to national security -- as the Executive Order on classification calls for.\" No increase in FBI Iraq slots resulted from this conversation, Toner said. He added in the daily press briefing that Kennedy would remain in his role and had the full confidence of Secretary of State John Kerry.  The FBI is releasing the documents after concluding its investigation into Clinton's server. After its review, the FBI found there was not evidence for any criminal charges related to the probe.  Still, Republicans were seizing on the new interviews Monday, using them to attack Clinton and calling for Kennedy's departure.  GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump tweeted simply, \"unbelievable.\" His campaign released a statement from spokesman Jason Miller calling the documents \"deeply disturbing.\" \"The news that top Clinton aide Patrick Kennedy tried to engage in a blatant quid pro quo for changing the classification level of several of Clinton's emails shows a cavalier attitude towards protecting our nation's secrets,\" Miller said. \"These documents further demonstrate Secretary Clinton's complete disregard for properly handling classified information,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. \"This is exactly why I called on (Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper to deny her access to classified information. Moreover, a senior State Department official's attempt to pressure the FBI to hide the extent of this mishandling bears all the signs of a cover-up. This is why our aggressive oversight work in the House is so important, and it will continue.\" The top Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee and House Oversight Committee, Reps. Devin Nunes and Jason Chaffetz, respectively, put out a joint statement calling the allegations \"disturbing\" and asked for Kennedy's removal. \"We find Under Secretary Kennedy's actions extremely disturbing,\" Nunes and Chaffetz said. \"Those who receive classified intelligence should not barter in it -- that is reckless behavior with our nation's secrets. Someone who would try to get classification markings doctored should not continue serving in the State Department or retain access to classified information. Therefore, President Obama and Secretary Kerry should immediately remove Undersecretary Kennedy pending a full investigation.\" And the Republican National Committee also seized on the exchange, saying the White House was trying to \"shield\" Clinton.  \"It is deeply troubling that a top State Department official close to Hillary Clinton offered the FBI a 'quid pro quo' to hide the full extent to which she mishandled classified information,\" Chairman Reince Priebus said. \"The Obama administration's blatant attempts to shield Hillary Clinton from accountability for her reckless conduct will only inflame the growing distrust Americans have for their own government.\"\n",
      "                             President Barack Obama defended Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" but said he would not interfere with the ongoing Justice Department and FBI investigation into her private email server. \"I can guarantee that,\" Obama answered when asked by Fox News' Chris Wallace if he would direct the Justice Department to treat Clinton as the evidence shows. \"That is institutionally how we have always operated: I do not talk to the attorney general about pending investigations. I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations. We have a strict line,\" he said. Wallace asked Obama if he can still stand by his previous claims that the emails did not jeopardize national security. \"I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America's national security,\" Obama said. \"Now what I've also said ... there's a carelessness in terms of managing emails that she has owned and she recognizes. But I also think it is important to keep this in perspective.\" The President tried to distinguish between different levels of top secret -- or classified information -- as a means of defending Clinton. \"What I also know, because I handle a lot of classified information, is that there's classified, and then there's classified,\" he said. \"There's stuff that is really top secret-top secret, and there's stuff that is being presented to the President or the secretary of state, that you might not want on the transom, or going out over the wire, but is basically stuff that you could get in open source.\" Obama said his former secretary of state saying she would \"never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.\" \"This is somebody whose served her country for four years as secretary of state, and did an outstanding job, and no one has suggested that in some ways as a consequence of how she's handled emails that that detracted from her excellent ability to carry out her duties,\" he said. Obama was also questioned by Wallace on criticism to his personal responses to terrorist attacks, citing the President calling the November terrorist attacks in Paris \"a setback.\" \"There isn't a president who's taken more terrorists off the field then me over the last seven and  half years,\" Obama said, defending himself. \"I'm the guy who calls the families or meets with them or hugs them or tries to comfort a mom or a dad or a husband or a kid after a terrorist attack. So let's be very clear how much I prioritize this. This is my No. 1 job and we have been doing it effectively,\" he said.\n",
      "                             On the campaign trail Saturday, it didn't take much time for Chris Christie to attack Hillary Clinton on her private email use. \"The real story is this -- I believe in my heart -- that Hillary Clinton doesn't want us to know what she's doing. She believes we don't have a right to know. When I'm president of the United States, you have a right to know what your president is doing, and we have the obligation to be held accountable for what we're doing,\" Christie said to around 130 voters gathered to hear him at a town hall event in Laconia, New Hampshire.  Christie spoke for around two hours and answered 13 questions. He told voters it was his 18th town hall in New Hampshire and contrasted his style of running with that of the Democratic frontrunner.  \"The worst thing about this is the arrogance of Mrs. Clinton -- that's the worst part of this. Here's a woman who won't answer questions,\" Christie said. \"She's running for president of the United States. You think you'd see her in a room like this taking any question that comes up? No chance. She doesn't do that.\" Clinton's New Hampshire campaign has actually held several town halls with the candidate, but Christie has made the Q&amp;A format a signature of his campaign. \"Whenever there's been any questions raised about me as governor of New Jersey I stand up and I answer every question, that's what you need to do to be held accountable,\" he said Saturday. \"If she mishandled classified information and obstructed justice, then she deserves to be prosecuted. She sure as hell doesn't deserve to be president of the United States,\" Christie said.  Christie also said recently that he would have been blasted in the wake of the Bridgegate scandal if he had done the same as Clinton, and wiped his server clean. \"I had a private email account, but I didn't do my business on a private email account. She did everything on that account and then when she knows people are concerned about it, she gets the server cleaned,\" Christie said on CNN's \"New Day.\" But some say Christie committed similar acts in the wake of the Bridgegate scandal.  They point to Christie's own use of a private email account -- as well as the deletion of text messages -- during the height of the Bridgegate scandal in December of 2013. Emails from the governor, that were turned over to the New Jersey legislature in response to subpoenas about the bridge scandal, show Christie used a personal Yahoo account, said New Jersey Democratic Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, who led the investigation.  Christie's private email use was revealed when the emails were first released earlier this year, but it has gained attention as the governor has used heightened rhetoric around Clinton's own email use.  \"This is the guy who's criticizing Hillary Clinton for using a private email account? That's exactly what he did. It's a case of the pot calling the kettle black,\" Wisniewski told CNN.  According to Wisniewski, the set of emails discussed edits to a statement about the resignation of Port Authority official David Wildstein, who has since pleaded guilty to his involvement in lane closures affecting traffic over George Washington Bridge. When asked about the text messages earlier this week, Christie told CBS News his office wasn't under investigation at the time. \"We have 12 missing text messages that were sent to me by someone when we weren't under investigation and didn't even know what was going on. Mrs. Clinton deleted emails when she was under subpoena. In my neck of the woods, we call that obstruction of justice,\" Christie said.  Christie said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he'd used a private email account for state government business only once -- and it was when an aide inadvertently sent an innocuous press release to the wrong account.  \"My press secretary sent it to my private email account I'm sure inadvertently and I responded to it,\" Christie said.  \"We cannot compare that can we? To someone having a private email server in the basement of their home? Where they did all the government business on a private email server in their basement,\" he said. \"We can't compare that to having national security secrets.\" Wisniewski told CNN Saturday the text messages were sent while a state assembly panel on the lane closures was occurring and that Christie was well aware of the investigation at the time.  \"In his public statements, he maligned me and others for the investigation, so you can't have it both ways,\" Wisniewski told CNN.  He added that Christie's criticism of Clinton is \"off base\" and shows that he is \"trying to revive his failing presidential campaign.\" The latest polls from Quinnipiac University and CNN/ORC show the New Jersey governor with around 3-4% of the Republican vote and hovering around 10th place nationally.  Christie's presidential campaign told CNN that the texts were deleted before the full extent of the scandal was known and that in January 2014, once it was clear there was an issue, all staff members were told not to delete or destroy any correspondence or documents.   The campaign argues that Democrats are trying to distract from Clinton's flaws as a candidate and that Christie's email use is very different from Clinton's, due to the sensitive nature of her correspondence.  Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for the governor's office, told CNN that there was no state law at the time that required the use of state email in official business. In early 2014 that policy changed and now requires state employees to maintain their records by using state issued email addresses.  \n",
      "                             A federal judge Wednesday approved a plan for the taking of depositions by several current and former State Department officials about Hillary Clinton's email server.  Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, approved a joint proposal presented by Judicial Watch and the State Department to take the depositions of officials including Cheryl D. Mills, Clinton's former chief of staff, Huma Abedin, a senior adviser to Clinton, and Bryan Pagliano, a State Department employee who serviced and maintained the server.  Sullivan said the officials could be asked details about processing and responding to record requests as well as issues such as which State Department officials and employees had used an account on the clintonemail.com system to conduct official government business. Sullivan established an eight-week time frame.   \"The circumstances surrounding approval of Mrs. Clinton's use of clintonemail.com for official government business, as well as the manner in which it was operated, are issues that need to be explored in discovery to enable the Court to resolve, as a matter of law, the adequacy of the State Department's search of relevant records in response to Judicial Watch's FOIA request,\" Sullivan wrote in the order. He left open the possibility that Clinton could be deposed at a later time if necessary.  \"Based on information learned during discovery, the deposition of Mrs. Clinton, may be unnecessary,\" Sullivan wrote. Judicial Watch initially brought the lawsuit in 2013 with a focus on employment records of Abedin, who was allowed to engage in private sector work while also working at the State Department. The case was reopened in June 2015 after The New York Times revealed the server's existence.  Judicial Watch argued that it needed limited discovery to ascertain whether the State Department conducted an adequate search of its records for pertinent documents. The State Department objected to the discovery, but the parties reached an agreement over the relevant scope.  Sullivan acknowledged that it is unusual to grant discovery in a Freedom of Information case but he said discovery should be permitted, \"when a plaintiff raises a sufficient question as to the agency's good faith in processing documents in response to a FOIA request.\" \n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton's longtime pastor plagiarized the writings of another minister in a new book scheduled to be released on Tuesday.    \"Strong for a Moment Like This: The Daily Devotions of Hillary Rodham Clinton,\" is based on emails that the Rev. Bill Shillady, a United Methodist minister, wrote to Clinton from April 2015 through December of last year. Shillady described his emails as a way to minister to a candidate in perpetual motion.  The pastor and politician formed a spiritual bond after meeting in New York in 2002. Shillady co-officiated at Chelsea Clinton's wedding in 2010, presided over Clinton's mother's memorial service and blessed her grandchildren. Clinton is a lifelong Methodist.  Clinton appears on the cover of \"Strong for a Moment Like This,\" and wrote a foreword for the book praising Shillady and his writings. She is scheduled to appear at an event next month in New York promoting the book. A spokesman for Clinton did not respond immediately to a request for comment.   Shillady holds the copyright on the book, which includes 11 pages of end notes crediting some source material. But it does not credit one source from which an especially emotional devotion borrowed heavily: a blog post by the Rev. Matthew Deuel, a pastor at Mission Point Community Church in Warsaw, Indiana.  In an interview with CNN last week, Shillady described rising at 4 a.m. on the morning after Clinton lost the presidential election to write the devotion. He did not mention borrowing material for it, which is listed first in his soon-to-be published book.   On Monday, Shillady apologized, saying he was \"stunned\" by the similarities between his email to Clinton and Deuel's column. In a text message, Deuel said he and Shillady talked on Monday, and that he had accepted Shillady's apology.  'Sunday is coming'  On November 9, the day after the election, Shillady sent Clinton an email titled, \"Sunday is Coming.\" Last week, CNN published that email as part of an excerpt of the new book. The piece was widely shared on social media, with many liberals saying its sentiments struck an emotional chord.    On Saturday, though, Deuel contacted a CNN reporter, saying some paragraphs in Shillady's writings appeared to be \"inspired\" by a blog post he wrote in March 2016. For example, Deuel wrote: \"For the disciples and Christ followers in the first century, Good Friday represented the day that everything fell apart. All was lost. The momentum and hope of a man, claiming to be the Son of God, the Messiah who was supposed to change everything, had been executed. Shillady's email to Clinton, published in his book, says: \"For the disciples and Christ's followers in the first century, Good Friday represented the day that everything fell apart. All was lost. The momentum and hope of a man claiming to be the Son of God, the Messiah who was supposed to change everything, had been executed.\" Likewise, Deuel wrote: \"Death will be shattered. Hope will be restored. Redemption is coming. But first, we must live through the darkness and seeming hopelessness of Friday.\" Shillady's email to Clinton, published in his book, says: \"Death will be shattered. Hope will be restored. But first, we must live through the darkness and seeming hopelessness of Friday.\" Shillady echoes other ideas and phrases from Deuel's column as well, such as the notion that \"life is filled with a lot of Fridays,\" times of trouble marked by jobs lost, friendships betrayed and bad medical diagnoses received.  When asked about the similarities between his email and Deuel's blog post, Shillady said the devotions he sent to Clinton were often pastiches of material  he found on the Internet or old sermons he delivered as a former pastor. He had collected writings on Good Friday with the idea that it might be useful should Clinton lose the election, he said. \"I do not remember cutting and pasting from a particular column so much as bits and pieces from a variety of places on the Internet,\" Shillady told CNN on Monday.  In a later statement, Shillady apologized to Deuel.  \"In preparing the devotional on the morning of November 9, I was determined to provide comfort with the familiar adage that 'It's Friday But Sunday is Coming.'\" I searched for passages that offered perspective of this theme. I am now stunned to realize the similarity between Matt Deuel's blog sermon and my own. Clearly, portions of my devotional that day incorporate his exact words. I apologize to Matt for not giving him the credit he deserves.\" Shillady said he did not know if other material from his forthcoming book, published by Abingdon Press, the book publishing arm of the United Methodist Publishing House, was likewise copied without attribution from other authors. Mary Catherine Dean, Abingdon Press's editor in chief, said, \"'Strong For A Moment Like This' is a heavily annotated work, in which Rev. Shillady has credited more than 200 sources. We worked with Rev. Shillady to faithfully cite all of the many contributors to the devotionals.\" Dean said she has accepted Shillady's explanation that the lack of citation for Deuel's work was an oversight.  \"His failure to attribute portions of the November 9 devotional does not change the fact that the 365 passages in the book were sent to Hillary Clinton, are part of the historical record of her campaign, and gave her the inspiration to stay strong.\" 'The last thing the world needs' Deuel said he was \"shocked\" when he read Shillady's email to Clinton posted on CNN.com. But amid turmoil in the United States and elsewhere, the pastor said he is \"not interested in publicly pursuing anything.\" \"The last thing the world needs right now is two pastors having a public dispute over a blog. The reality is, there's nothing new under the sun.\" Indeed, many Christian ministers have used the phrase \"It's Friday, but Sunday is coming,\" to contrast the sorrows of life with the despair and joy of the Christian apostles. Deuel said his column was inspired by a sermon by the Rev. S.M. Lockridge from the 1950s. \"If my blog then, in turn, inspired Rev. Shillady and it was used to encourage Hillary Clinton, then praise God for that! Could it have been done differently? Probably,\" Deuel said. \"But for me to fire back publicly would be inappropriate and out of line on my part.\" \n",
      "                             As the State Department reopens its investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state, Clinton reiterated on Friday that her use of personal email was a \"mistake\" that she would \"certainly not do again.\" In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Clinton expressed \"relief\" that a Justice Department investigation did not result in criminal charges, and also suggested that she expects the State Department to take into consideration the Justice Department's conclusions. \"It was a mistake for me to use personal email. And I regret that. I am certainly relieved and glad that the investigation has concluded but I also know how important it is to make sure everybody understands that I would certainly not do that again,\" Clinton said.  Clinton noted on the State Department probe: \"I assume they will pursue whatever process they think is appropriate and I also assume that they will pay very close attention to what the findings were of the Justice Department investigation.\"  Clinton, who has in the past stated that she \"never sent or received\" classified materials on her personal email server, appeared to soften that language on Friday. \"I certainty did not believe that I received or sent any material that was classified,\" she told Blitzer.  The Republican National Committee quickly jumped on Clinton for the remark. \"Even now, Hillary Clinton is unwilling to tell the American people the truth about her illicit email server that broke the rules and put national security at risk,\" RNC spokesman Michael Short said in a statement. \"The only thing Hillary Clinton seems to be clarifying is that she is determined to continue misleading voters and obfuscating the facts about her reckless conduct as secretary of state.\" The State Department's announcement on Thursday was expected, as the department had suspended its probe while it was waiting for the Justice Department to complete its criminal investigation. But the State Department's announcement serves as a reminder that the email issue will continue to dog Clinton's campaign.  The State Department will now focus on whether current employees involved in handling or sending and receiving Clinton's emails should get disciplinary action, which could range from a reprimand to losing their security clearance. Former employees found to be mishandling classified information could also have notes put in their file that could also have consequences if they seek future employment with the government and need security clearance. Several senior State Department officials told CNN the investigation is a review of how various emails were handled. Investigators will determine the degree to which email traffic was classified at the time it was sent, and any determination about action against an individual would only come after a consideration about the emails themselves. \"Given the Department of Justice has now made its announcement, the State Department intends to conduct its internal review,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. \"I cannot provide specific information about the department's review, including what information we are evaluating. We will aim to be as expeditious as possible, but we will not put artificial deadlines on the process. Our goal will be to be as transparent as possible about our results, while complying with our various legal obligations. I'm not able to make commitments today one way or the other about what we will be able to disclose.\" State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said in April it was \"standard practice\" for the department to pause on its review during the law enforcement investigation.  Earlier this week, FBI Director James Comey recommended that no criminal charges be brought in the case, a finding that the Justice Department accepted on Wednesday. Comey was the subject of a lengthy grilling on Capitol Hill Thursday as he fielded questions from Republicans about the investigation, with House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz saying he would ask the FBI to probe whether Clinton lied to Congress about her email arrangements.  Republicans are trying other avenues to keep alive the email controversy that has clouded her presidential campaign for months. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for instance, asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to block access to classified briefings for Clinton for the rest of the campaign. The State Department's inspector general in May blasted Clinton's email use, saying that she failed to follow the rules or inform key department staff regarding her use of a private email server.\n",
      "                             Donald Trump on Friday accused his rival Hillary Clinton of engaging in \"pay for play\" for accepting an invitation to speak at a Clinton Global Initiative event in Morocco in exchange for a $12 million donation pledge to the Clinton Foundation from that country's king. The accusation is just the latest Trump has leveled against Clinton as he's argued she engaged in \"pay for play\" schemes involving the Clinton Foundation during her time as secretary of state. But the Clinton Global Initiative summit in Morocco that Clinton was set to attend in exchange for the $12 million pledge took place in May 2015 and was discussed in emails by Clinton's top aides in November 2014, after her tenure as secretary of state ended. Clinton did not end up attending the summit. CNN has reached out to the Clinton campaign for comment on Trump's comments and have not yet gotten a response.  RELATED: Clinton Foundation president rebuts Trump's 'pay-for-play' accusations The accusation is just another example in Trump's attempts to label Clinton as a \"corrupt\" figure as he increasingly looks to frame his candidacy as that of an outsider looking to shake up the system. \"Now from WikiLeaks, we just learned she tried to get 12 million (dollars) from the king of Morocco for an appearance,\" Trump said during a rally here Friday. \"More pay for play.\" Trump then went on to tout the series of ethics reforms he unveiled earlier this week that he would prevent members of Congress and executive branch officials from serving as lobbyists for at least five years after their government service concluded. Trump also called for imposing term limits on members of Congress. None of those reforms would have addressed the \"pay for play\" Trump alleged Friday that Clinton engaged in. RELATED - John Podesta emails: Latest Wikileaks release Trump's accusation came after WikiLeaks published its latest batch of emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's account, which revealed correspondence with Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin describing the Moroccan arrangement. Abedin wrote in a November 2014 email that Clinton's \"presence (at the 2015 summit) was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this.\" In another email two months later, Abedin wrote that \"the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If (Clinton) was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter.\" Abedin adds that it was Clinton's \"idea\" to hold the Clinton Foundation meeting in Morocco and said it would be problematic for Clinton to pull out at the last minute. \"It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months. She created this mess and she knows it,\" Abedin wrote. CNN cannot independently confirm the emails' authenticity. The Clinton campaign has declined to verify the emails but has not challenged any emails in other WikiLeaks releases. The emails were part of more than 50,000 hacked emails from Podesta's account that WikiLeaks claims to have. The organization has published 25,000 so far.  US officials have said there is \"mounting evidence\" that Russia is passing along hacked documents to WikiLeaks -- prompting concerns that the Russian government is seeking to influence the US elections. RELATED - Emails: Hillary Clinton campaign stressed about Al Gore before endorsement When asked about content of Podesta's emails during the final presidential debate Wednesday, Clinton said the Russians have \"engaged in espionage against Americans\" and that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would be Russian President Vladimir Putin's choice to be America's next leader because he would be a \"puppet\" for the Kremlin. \n",
      "                             FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private server before the November 8 election.  Officials are constantly meeting and debating whether there's any more room for them to add clarity without further harming the situation. The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin's emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner's laptop could be done in the next few days, US law enforcement officials told CNN.  But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely coordinating with other federal agencies to determine what -- if any -- classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. Ex-AGs Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder, Michael Mukasey rip FBI director \"From the beginning, Ms. Abedin has complied fully and voluntarily with State Department and law enforcement requests, including sitting for hours-long interviews and providing her work-related and potentially work-related documents,\" said Abedin's lawyer, Karen Dunn of Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, LLP, in statement to CNN.  \"Ms. Abedin's willing cooperation has been praised by members of Congress and law enforcement officials alike. She only learned for the first time on Friday, from press reports, of the possibility that a laptop belonging to Mr. Weiner could contain emails of hers. While the FBI has not contacted us about this, Ms. Abedin will continue to be, as she always has been, forthcoming and cooperative,\" Dunn said. FBI Director James Comey's decision to notify lawmakers of the review Friday is rocking the final days of the presidential race. Clinton's surrogates along with three former attorneys general have blasted Comey for violating FBI protocol designed to keep the bureau away from election-year politics. The investigators are using software comparable to a specialized search engine at FBI facilities in Quantico, Virginia, to try to isolate emails on Weiner's computer that could be pertinent to the Clinton email-server investigation, the law enforcement officials said. Some of that work was done earlier this month when agents conducting the Weiner investigation stumbled on the Abedin emails.  After that work is done, investigators will examine the emails they believe are relevant to the Clinton investigation to see if they contain classified information and, if so, whether the individuals who sent or received the emails knew the information was classified.  FBI officials also believe it's possible that investigators might have to conduct another interview with Abedin and others.   Officials say they are providing all the necessary resources to streamline the process given the sense of urgency so close to the election.  \"We are very aware of the pressure on us,\" one law enforcement official told CNN. \"This is not a resource problem.\"  In a letter to congressional Democrats Monday, Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik wrote Monday that the Justice Department is moving as quickly as possible.  \"We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,\" Kadzik wrote.  Officials say it's unlikely the public will hear from FBI Director James Comey until it is more clear about the substance of the pertinent emails, the officials said. Comey is under fire from Democrats in the wake of his Friday disclosure to lawmakers that the FBI is once again looking into emails potentially tied to its Clinton investigation.  FBI discovered Clinton-related emails weeks ago Clinton's campaign, sensing political danger, is calling on Comey to immediately release more information about the emails. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that Comey had meant to transparently disclose information by sending the letter -- but \"clearly it had the opposite of the intended effect.\"  Comey's revelation left many unanswered questions about the content of the emails and how they could be related to Clinton, at a particularly politically sensitive time for the Democratic nominee eight days out from the election. Former US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, a Republican, on Monday slammed Comey, saying his letter was an \"error in judgment.\"  \"You don't comment on investigations because commenting on the investigation may jeopardize the investigation. And that's the box that he's put himself in, because people are now calling for more information -- for release of the emails,\" Gonzales told CNN's John Berman and Kate Bolduan on \"At This Hour.\" Gonzales, who served in the George W. Bush administration, said Comey wouldn't have been misleading voters by withholding the news until after November 8. \"If you delay the announcement, hopefully it's not going to jeopardize an investigation, it's not going to jeopardize the pursuit of justice, and voters will have the opportunity to vote on Election Day without information that may in fact be incomplete or untrue,\" he said. Eric Holder, the attorney general during much of President Barack Obama's administration, called Comey's action \"incorrect\" in The Washington Post on Monday.  \"I served with Jim Comey, and I know him well. This is a very difficult piece for me to write. He is a man of integrity and honor. I respect him. But good men make mistakes. In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications,\" Holder wrote. \"It is incumbent upon him -- or the leadership of the department -- to dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day. It is up to the director to correct his mistake -- not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people.\" Donald Trump: 'Thank you, Huma. Good job, Huma' Despite the backlash, Comey stands by his decision and believes he did the right thing, according to a source familiar with Comey's thinking. In Comey's view, he was faced with two bad options: Not be upfront with Congress and risk the news leaking out or violating DOJ protocol and living up to his word to Congress to provide any updates related to the investigation. He chose the lesser of the two bad choices in his mind. \"He's doing okay,\" the source said. \n",
      "                             Bryan Pagliano, a former Hillary Clinton staffer who helped set up her private email server, has accepted an immunity offer from the FBI and the Justice Department to provide an interview to investigators, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN Wednesday. The FBI has been asking for Pagliano's cooperation for months as dozens of investigators pored over thousands of Clinton emails in a secure room on the fourth floor of FBI headquarters.  The probe shifted into a new phase recently as investigators completed the review of the emails, working with intelligence agencies and the State Department to determine whether they were classified.  The Washington Post first reported Pagliano's cooperation. \"As we have said since last summer, Secretary Clinton has been cooperating with the Justice Department's security inquiry, including offering in August to meet with them to assist their efforts if needed,\" said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton's presidential campaign.  Fallon added that the campaign was \"pleased\" Pagliano was cooperating with the Justice Department.  Last fall, when Pagliano invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and declined to talk to congressional investigators, Fallon said: \"(Clinton has) encouraged everyone to cooperate because we want to make every good-faith effort to be transparent and answer any questions people have. With Mr. Pagliano, we encouraged him as well because we don't think he has any reason to not be transparent about the help that he provided from an IT perspective, but unfortunately, it is his choice what to do.\" A message left with Pagliano's attorney was not immediately returned. With the completion of the email review, FBI investigators are expected to shift their focus on whether the highly sensitive government information, including top secret and other classified matters, found on Clinton's private email server constitutes a crime.  RELATED: Clinton emails: What have we learned? The emails released publicly show some Clinton aides sent the sensitive information, often from the State Department's unclassified email system, to others, and eventually to Clinton at her private email address. She didn't use a State Department email account.  The released emails appear to align with her public statements that she didn't send emails that were marked as classified.  She did receive emails from aides that, while not marked as classified, did contain information that should not have been handled outside the government's secure email system, the emails released so far have found. The FBI reviewers oversaw the process that upgraded the emails now known to be highly sensitive as part of a series of State Department Freedom of Information Act releases that ended Monday. Clinton has said she hasn't been asked to be interviewed for the FBI probe. Republican candidates quickly pounced on the development Wednesday night. \"This is an ominous development for the Clinton campaign and for Democrats as a whole,\" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told Fox News' Megyn Kelly. \"This suggests that the investigation is moving to a whole other level. She is going to be a badly wounded candidate, and if we nominate a strong Republican nominee, we're going to win this general election.\"\n",
      "                             Donald Trump on Thursday called for his likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to be imprisoned. \"I will say this, Hillary Clinton has got to go to jail,\" Trump told supporters here as he slammed Clinton's foreign policy speech earlier in the day in which Clinton called Trump dangerous and \"temperamentally unfit\" to be president. \"Folks, honestly, she's guilty as hell,\" Trump said of the Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Trump has previously accused Clinton of breaking federal law, but his comments on Thursday are his most direct call yet for Clinton to face jail time over her use of private email to conduct official State Department affairs. The FBI is investigating Clinton's use of a private emails to determine whether anyone improperly handled classified information. At a news conference earlier this week, Trump declined to say whether he believes Clinton's private email use amounted to a felony. Trump also suggested Thursday that if Clinton is not indicted over her email use, he would direct his attorney general to investigate her. \"Five years' statute of limitations, if I win. Everything is going to be fair but I'm sure the attorney general will take a very good look at it,\" Trump said. Trump peppered his speech Thursday with digs at Clinton but largely avoided responding directly to many of the claims Clinton leveled against him earlier in the day, in which she accused the presumptive Republican nominee of having \"dangerously incoherent\" ideas on foreign policy. Instead, Trump hit Clinton over her email use and critiqued Clinton's speaking style, suggesting that \"it's hard to stay awake\" when listening to Clinton speak. \n",
      "                             For 635 days, the Rev. Bill Shillady woke at 4 a.m. to send an email to Hillary Clinton. He began in April 2015, when Clinton announced her candidacy for president, and ended in December 2016, as she dealt with a devastating defeat.  A United Methodist minister, Shillady met Clinton, a lifelong Methodist, in 2002, when Shillady pastored a church in New York City. Over the years, a spiritual kinship formed between the pastor and politician, and as Clinton began her second run for the White House, Shillady offered to send her daily devotionals based on the day's news. Sometimes they were snippets of Scripture with encouraging mini-sermons. Other days' devotions included poems by Elizabeth Barrett Browning or insights from the late Catholic writer Henri Nouwen that sought to put political troubles into proper perspective. Eventually, Shillady recruited a team of writers, including dozens of women who formed a \"We Pray with Her,\" group.  Clinton mentioned the digital devotions several times during the campaign, saying they helped keep her \"centered.\" That was especially true, she told Shillady, in the days and weeks after the presidential election, while she reeled from her unexpected loss.  Shillady collected the devotions in a book, called \"Strong for a Moment Like This,\" which will publish on August 15. The minister talked to CNN this week about the email he sent Clinton the morning after the election, how faith is leading her \"out of the woods\" and why he expects to soon see the former politician in the pulpit.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  I remember talking to you on Election Day, and you sounded pretty optimistic. What were those 24 hours like for you?  My writing team sent (Clinton) a message about every half-hour during the day, and everything seemed fine. They had asked me to open the Javits Center program (where Clinton's victory rally was to be held) with a prayer, and as the night went on, it was like a funeral wake. The Javits Center just got quieter and quieter. I went home to bed, and then I got up to write the hardest devotional I had to write. I didn't get much sleep that night.  Had you planned what you would write if Clinton lost the election?  About a week before the election, I wrote to my writing team and said, \"Friends we need to think about devotionals that celebrate victory or help us deal with defeat.\" The devotional itself took me a little longer to write because I remember crying as I would write. Your Nov. 9 devotional compares Hillary Clinton's loss to Good Friday. That's pretty intense.   I woke up that morning (on November 9) and it felt like maybe what the Apostles experienced on Good Friday. Their leader, master and savior was dead and gone and they didn't know what to do. And I thought of this phrase from the Rev. Tony Compolo: Good Friday was tough, but Sunday was coming.  Read Shillady's November 9 email to Hillary Clinton  In that metaphor, what does \"Sunday\" represent for Hillary Clinton's career, for her life?  \"Sunday\" is now for her. She's the most relaxed I've ever seen her, having fun with her grandchildren. I think she'll continue to speak out on issues that are important to her on women and gender and children's health. \"Sunday\" is not another election for her. She's moving on with her life. So you don't think she'll run for president again?  I don't think she would run again. I don't have any knowledge other than my personal speculation, but she's fine where she is. She's told me that a number of times. She certainly was heartbroken, but her faith helped her move through that darkness. Can you speak a bit more about that? What spiritual practices helped her deal with her defeat?  She knows the Bible remarkably well, and I think she knows what passages to turn to when she needs inspiration or solace. She reads her Scripture every day. That,  for her, is a practice of spiritual discipline. She told me that my email was the first she opened every day and and it helped keep her grounded and centered.  Since the election, she's also spent time walking in the woods and having time to think and pray. Now she says she's coming out of the woods.  And where will that lead her? To the pulpit, maybe?  We were having a photo shoot for the book and chatting about preaching and she said, \"Bill, I think I'd like to preach.\" In United Methodism, there's a tradition of having laypeople preach from the pulpit, and I think she's going to look at occasionally doing that and sharing the good news without it being a politically charged environment.   Some pundits say that Clinton lost, in part, because she didn't share more about her faith. Do you think that's true?  I think it's partially true, but she did speak a lot about her faith at various townhalls and rallies and when meeting people on the street. But it was not reported, and it wasn't what her critics wanted to look at. She talked about her faith every time she was asked about it, but within the Methodist culture, we aren't people who wear our religion our on sleeves.  Clinton seemed most comfortable talking about spirituality, and connecting it to her politics, in black churches. Why do you think that might be?  Maybe she didn't have to be as guarded there, because there weren't as many critics. She is very comfortable in the pulpit. It's something that comes naturally to her, and she knows the Bible. That's why I think she'd make a great preacher.  When you talked to Clinton after the election, what did you say?  It was the Saturday after the election and we spent some time talking on the phone. She expressed how brokenhearted she was and how worried for the nation and what the future holds for people. But what was surprising to me is that she spent most of the call expressing gratitude to all the writers who were part of my team. She went on and on about how important the devotions had been to her, especially those we sent to her on November 9, 10 and 11. For her, it was a reminder that faith would get her through the difficult times.   How about yourself? Was your faith challenged by the election results?  It wasn't a challenge to my faith in terms of believing or not believing in God. I'm a bit of a process theologian, which means that, as life goes along, I believe in an all-loving God who may not always be in control, rather than an all-powerful God who is not loving. But I was definitely depressed for a few months after the election.  What pulled you out of that depression?  I guess editing the book of devotionals. As I began to think about how the book would come together, it pulled me back from that darkness. The devotionals are inspiring. There's a hopeful sense that a better future is coming, and I had to live into that. \n",
      "                             Vice President Mike Pence defended his use of a personal email account to conduct state business while he was Indiana's governor, saying \"there's no comparison\" between his situation and the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server that rocked the 2016 presidential campaign.   \"There's no comparison whatsoever,\" Pence said following an event he did with House Speaker Paul Ryan in Janesville, Wisconsin, when asked about whether his situation gave him any sympathy for the Democratic presidential nominee.  Pence used a personal email when he discussed issues like the resettling of Syrian refugees and other matters on an AOL account that was hacked in a phishing scam, according to emails released Thursday. In one September 2014 exchange, Pence asked his then-homeland security adviser John Hill for an \"update of the investigation in Columbus (Indiana) following the vandalism ... to area churches ... Including the church I grew up in.\" In another email from November 2015, Pence asked his communications staff to promote an op-ed from then-Sen. Dan Coats about Indiana's fight to bar Syrian refugees from settling in the state.  Hill also alerted Pence to an FBI terror assessment in another exchange included in 30 pages of emails provided to CNN by Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb's office in response to a public records request. The emails and the successful hack of Pence's email account were first reported Thursday night by The Indianapolis Star. It's unclear from the release how often Pence used his AOL account for state business versus his state-provided email address.  A Pence official confirmed Friday evening that boxes of emails were delivered to the Indiana State House on Thursday. The official would not specify how many boxes, but said the emails were a mixture of messages from the governor's personal account to state account and from his personal account to non-state governmental accounts. The official said the emails will now be managed and handled under the Indiana Public Access to Records Act. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said the counsel that was going through Pence's emails attempted to deliver the boxes on January 9, which was Gov. Eric Holcomb's inauguration day, but because the day was so hectic, the new administration was unsure where they should go. Pence's counsel decided at the time to hold onto the boxes, Lotter said. Earlier this week, the vice president realized that the boxes of emails had still not been delivered and asked his counsel to deliver them, according to the Pence official. For months on the campaign trail, Pence accused Clinton of being dishonest and threatening US national security because she used an unsecured private email server while she was secretary of state. A few days before the general election, on November 2, Pence said at a rally in Colorado that the \"FBI has reopened the investigation in to HRC's private email server. It's a serious matter. Now we commend the FBI in this case for following the facts because in America, no one is above the law.\" Pence's email was compromised last spring, according to a Pence official, and emails were sent from his account saying that he was robbed on an overseas trip and he needed money. After the scam was discovered, he set up an entirely new private email account, the official told CNN. Holcomb declined to release further emails citing an exemption in Indiana's public records law that allows officials to withhold documents discussing the creation of public policy, according to The Star.  A Pence official would not comment or characterize what is in the AOL emails that have not been released. Pence spokesman Marc Lotter told CNN in a statement: \"Similar to previous governors, during his time as governor of Indiana, Mike Pence maintained a state email account and a personal email.\"  Lotter did not explain if previous Indiana governors also used their personal email accounts to conduct state business. Clinton's use of private email was the subject of a federal investigation that determined she had exchanged classified information on a server based out of her New York home. The FBI determined Clinton's actions were not worth prosecuting, but FBI Director James Comey last summer berated her actions. It was not immediately clear if Pence handled classified information on his her personal email account, although, as a governor, he would be less likely to do so compared to Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time. \"He did everything to the letter of the law, he turned all his emails over, unlike Hillary Clinton, who lost at least 30,000, who knows how many more, on her private server,\" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. Sanders added: \"He's a governor, which means he wasn't handling classified information like she was.\" CNN submitted a public records request to the Indiana governor's office in September for emails between Pence, using his personal AOL email, and his top staff. Pence's office never responded to follow-up requests from CNN, but a spokeswoman for Holcomb said she was reviewing the request. Pence used his personal AOL account to discuss state work periodically from the start of his administration in 2013. Pence recently hired an outside lawyer to review his emails and submit them to the state, which could then be released or withheld at Holcomb's discretion.  The Indiana Democratic Party released a statement on Thursday calling for \"full disclosure\" on Pence's use of private emails. \"It seems Governor Holcomb has chosen to withhold a portion of the public work product Pence sent on private servers, and Indiana Democrats want to know why.\" This story has been updated to reflect breaking news.\n",
      "                             Donald Trump intended to say Wednesday that Hillary Clinton's use of an email server during her tenure at the State Department was an act of \"premeditation.\" But when he flubbed the line and instead suggested it was due to \"premedication,\" he embraced that possibility as well. \"Hillary Clinton created an illegal private email server -- deliberately, willfully and with total premedication -- premeditation,\" Trump said, correcting himself. He then added: \"Could be the first way was right actually.\" \"You know, I might like the first way better. 'Premedication,' that's a very -- premedication, I think I like it. Wow,\" Trump continued as the crowd cheered him on.  The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to an email requesting clarification on Trump's remarks. The real estate mogul and his supporters have recently called the Democratic nominee's health into question in an effort to undermine her candidacy.  After Clinton said earlier this month that she \"short-circuited\" answers about the email controversy, Trump quipped at a New Hampshire rally, \"She took a short-circuit in the brain. She's got problems.\" \"Honestly, I don't think she's all there,\" he added. Meanwhile, \"healthers\" are using junk science and conspiracy theories to argue that Clinton is suffering from a series of debilitating brain injuries. Former New York City mayor and Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani accused the mainstream media over the weekend of hiding evidence, then encouraged doubters to \"go online and put down 'Hillary Clinton illness.'\"  Trump's remarks suggesting \"premedication\" on Clinton's part also come as he continued to accuse her of engaging in corruption during her time as secretary of state, prompting his supporters to cry out with the staple chant of \"Lock her up! Lock her up!\" Trump once again read from teleprompters Wednesday, which he's done at every rally since early last week. Trump was introduced by Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, who argued that Clinton \"committed numerous, numerous serious federal felonies\" and that recent emails suggesting favors traded between the Clinton Foundation and Clinton's State Department amounted to a scandal potentially \"bigger than Watergate.\"\n",
      "                             A federal judge set a preliminary schedule Monday for the release of nearly 15,000 documents between Hillary Clinton and top aides when she was the secretary of state. The State Department was directed to assess 14,900 documents it received from the FBI as part of the investigation into Clinton's use of her private email server while she was secretary of state, determine a plan to release the documents and report back to the court September 23.   Powell talks Clinton emails: 'Her people are trying to pin it on me' The State Department had proposed releasing the documents the second week of October, but Judge James Boasberg of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, at the request of the conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, is asking State to focus on new documents uncovered by the FBI.  It's unclear how many of the documents are emails.  FBI Director James Comey said in July the FBI \"discovered several thousand work-related e-mails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014.\"  \"As we have previously explained, the State Department voluntarily agreed to produce to Judicial Watch any emails sent or received by Secretary Clinton in her official capacity during her tenure as Secretary of State which are contained within the material turned over by the FBI and which were not already processed for FOIA by the State Department,\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday. Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill upped the political pressure on Clinton by subpoenaing three technology companies involved in her unusual home server setup.   The subpoenas were issued after the companies did not cooperate with a House committee's investigation into the issue, said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who chairs the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, \"Companies providing services to Secretary Hillary Clinton's private email account and server are not above the law.  These companies have failed to comply with our committee's request for documents and interviews that would provide information critical to understanding Secretary Clinton's private server and informing policy changes in how to prevent similar email arrangements in the future,\" said Smith who added the information was needed to determine if Clinton's servers met federal government security standards.   The letters to the companies containing the House subpoenas were also signed by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, who chairs the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is looking into the issue. \"The companies have direct and unique knowledge of her private server and email account. The information being sought is a crucial step in bringing greater transparency to Secretary Clinton's 'extreme careless' -- I would call it dangerously reckless and grossly negligent -- email practices,\" said the senator who is facing a tough re-election race this year. The subpoenas were issued to Platte River Networks in Denver, Colorado, SECNAP Network Security Corporation in Boca Raton, Florida, and Datto, Incorporated in Norwalk, Connecticut.  \n",
      "                             The 2016 presidential race is coming down to the wire, but an average of national polls show Hillary Clinton continuing to edge out Donald Trump with five days to go before Election Day.  CNN's Poll of Polls shows Clinton leading Donald Trump, 46%-42%, which was updated Thursday to include two new national polls taken after Friday's revelation that the FBI is reviewing new emails to see if they pertain to the bureau's probe into Clinton's handling of classified material at the State Department. The CNN Poll of Polls is based on an average of the five most recent national phone polls. In one, via CBS News and the New York Times, Clinton leads Trump among likely voters nationwide, 45%-42%. The other, a new ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, shows Clinton with a 2-point edge, 47%-45%.   In each poll, Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein -- once thought of as potential spoilers -- hover in the low single-digits. The CNN Poll of Polls currently shows Johnson and Stein at 4% and 3%, respectively.  It was only a couple weeks ago when Clinton's lead ballooned in several national polls after the release of a video in which Trump could be heard making sexually aggressive comments about how he treats women. That revelation was followed by an onslaught of sexual misconduct allegations levied against Trump that seemed to only further diminish his chances. Trump denied all the allegations. Clinton's campaign was then rocked by the letter FBI Director James Comey sent to members of Congress regarding the potential for new email scrutiny. The latest CBS/New York Times poll suggests that most voters are unaffected by the development. About 6-in-10 likely voters who haven't cast their ballot yet said the FBI's announcement makes no difference to them, while 32% said it made them less likely to support Clinton. The CBS/New York Times poll was conducted October 28-November 1 using phone interviews with 1,333 likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The ABC/Washington Post tracking poll was conducted October 29-November 1 using phone interviews with 1,167 likely voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton expressed sympathy earlier this year for Bernie Sanders supporters who \"are living in their parents' basement\" who were attracted to his \"false promise\" because they are \"children of the Great Recession.\" The comments were posted late Friday by the conservative website Washington Free Beacon, which says it obtained the audio from a Clinton campaign staffer's hacked email. The recording comes to light as Clinton has emphasized reaching out to millennials in an effort to attract Sanders supporters to her campaign. Speaking to a gathering of campaign supporters in February, Clinton said some of Sanders' followers \"are new to politics completely. They're children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents' basement.\" She continued: \"If you're feeling like you're consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn't pay a lot, and doesn't have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing. I think we all should be really understanding of that.\"  The Democratic nominee -- who at one point said she didn't want to \"overpromise\" and \"be clear about the progress we can make\" -- questioned if Sanders' supporters were adequately informed. \"There's just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free health care, that what we've done hasn't gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, 'Scandinavia,' whatever that means,\" she says in the audio. \"And half the people don't know what that means, but it's something that they deeply feel.\" She also said: \"I don't think you tell idealistic people, particularly young people, that they've bought into a false promise. You try to do the best you can to say, 'Hey that's his view. That's what he's offering you. But here's another way, where actually we can achieve a lot of what we have said starting Day One, and make a real difference in people's lives.'\" In a statement, the Clinton campaign did not dispute the audio's authenticity. \"As Hillary Clinton said in those remarks, she wants young people to be idealistic and set big goals. She is fighting for exactly what the millennial generation cares most about -- a fairer more equal, just world,\" said Glen Caplin, a campaign spokesman. He added: \"She's inspired by the optimism and the drive of this generation and Sanders supporters across the country -- and they've helped her craft and promote the most progressive platform in Democratic party history.\" A message left with Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, was not immediately returned. But Mike Casca, a Sanders spokesman, tweeted that Clinton's comments were sympathetic and understanding of the supporters' frustrations. Clinton is not polling as well with millennial voters as President Barack Obama did in 2008 and 2012, with many backing Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.  But following the Democratic convention, the Clinton campaign has enlisted surrogates such as Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, first lady Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton to stump for Clinton and convince young people to back her. Clinton also has embraced some of the policy positions that made Sanders such a hit with millenials, such as a $15 federal minimum wage and greater taxpayer funding for health care.   Trump on Saturday night leaned into the issue as he made his latest play to earn the votes of Sanders' supporters. Speaking at a rally in Manheim, Pennsylvania, Trump accused Clinton of \"demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters\" and argued that Clinton was calling Sanders supporters \"ignorant.\" Trump argued that Clinton delivered her comments in a \"really sarcastic tone because she's a sarcastic woman.\" \"To sum up, Hillary Clinton thinks Bernie Sanders supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement-dwellers,\" he said. Trump said he believed many of Sanders' supporters would cross over and vote for him, rather than Clinton, particularly because of their shared distrust on free trade. Echoes of past Clinton criticisms Clinton has previously suggested that Sanders was promising his supporters too much. In January, she told voters in Iowa that she agrees with \"very aspirational\" candidates but is \"also interested in getting things done.\" \"Now, I know some of the folks running are very aspirational, and I agree with that. We should all be aiming high. But I'm also interested in getting things done,\" she said in January. \"We can't wait to get a lot of new jobs. We can't wait to get incomes rising. We can't wait to make sure that we are moving forward together.  And I also know something about how to make sure that the financial markets, Wall Street, doesn't wreck our economy.\" The next month, Clinton told New Hampshire's WKXL that \"overpromising\" from candidates is one of the main reasons many people are disappointed in politics.  \"It worries me because I think overpromising is one of the roots of a lot of disappointment and the real dismissal of politics, on all sides of the political spectrum. And what we need now is to underpromise and overdeliver,\" she said.  \"What I'm trying to make the case for -- which is not as attractive -- it's not the romantic, dramatic appeal that others can make,\" Clinton added. \"But I think it is what the country will eventually respond to, because if you say, as I do, I'm going to fight to make real change, to build on progress, to go further, but I will not promise what I cannot, and know I cannot, deliver.\"\n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton admits that she made a series of mistakes during the 2016 election in her newly released memoir, conceding that she did not fully understand the American electorate and failed to muster the anger that many voters wanted to see. The book is full of Clinton focusing blame elsewhere, but in raw terms -- and with more directness than at any point since Election Day -- the former Democratic nominee admits that she made catastrophic mistakes during the campaign that led to her loss.  \"I've tried to learn from my own mistakes,\" she writes in her author's note. \"There are plenty, as you'll see in this book, and they are mine and mine alone.\" Clinton's admissions will likely be well received by Democrats who have wanted to hear her -- in unequivocal terms -- admit that she made mistakes that led to Trump's win. Many of those Democrats have been angered by Clinton equivocating at public events across the country about why she lost. But even as Clinton cops to her failures in direct terms in \"What Happened,\" her admissions are not unequivocal. Here are the mistakes Clinton admits she made: Her 'damn emails'  Clinton labels her decision to use a private email server as secretary of state -- and the subsequent investigations that led to nonstop stories -- as a \"boneheaded mistake\" that \"turned into a campaign-defining and --destroying scandal.\" Clinton says that the primary effect of the email controversy was that it repeatedly knocked her off her campaign message and left voters thinking that, once again, controversy was hanging over a Clinton vying for office. \"The controversy over my emails quickly cast a shadow over our efforts and threw us into a defensive crouch from which we never fully recovered,\" Clinton writes. The former first lady says that the media made far too much out of the email controversy -- \"The dumb decision by one presidential candidate to use a personal email account at the office ... got more coverage than any other issue in the whole race\" -- leaving voters feeling like it was the most important issue of the campaign. But she does say that she owns her email issue.  \"Right off the bat, let me say again that yes, the decision to use personal email instead of an official government account was mine and mine alone. I own that. I never meant to mislead anyone, never kept my email use secret, and always took classified information seriously,\" Clinton writes. Not understanding the electorate   Clinton's most introspective critique in \"What Happened\" is that she didn't fully understand the 2016 electorate and was the wrong candidate for the tone of the country. Clinton has repeatedly said she didn't think she would lose when she settled into her hotel suite on Election Night. But after extensive reflection -- which she called \"excruciating\" -- she realized that she may have been the wrong kind of candidate for an electorate that wanted anger and outrage. \"Still, in terms of fighting the previous war, I think it's fair to say that I didn't realize how quickly the ground was shifting under all our feet,\" Clinton writes. \"I was running a traditional presidential campaign with carefully thought-out policies and painstakingly built coalitions, while Trump was running a reality TV show that expertly and relentlessly stoked Americans' anger and resentment.\" Clinton said her 2016 campaign forced her to face her fears of her limitations as a candidate and the lessons she failed to learn from the 2008 campaign. But, in the end, she was \"unable to connect with the deep anger so many Americans felt or shake the perception that I was the candidate of the status quo. And look what they'd thrown at me.\" \"I go back over my own shortcomings and the mistakes we made,\" she writes. \"I take responsibility for all of them. You can blame the data, blame the message, blame anything you want -- but I was the candidate. It was my campaign. Those were my decisions.\"  Coal miners  Clinton said during a CNN town hall in March that she was going to \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business\" and, because of that, there needed to be programs to help retrain workers. The comment reverberated throughout Appalachia. Republicans seized on it and, as Clinton writes, the comment became the gaffe she regrets most.  \"You say millions of words in a campaign and you do your best to be clear and accurate. Sometimes it just comes out wrong,\" she writes. \"It wasn't the first time that happened during the 2016 election, and it wouldn't be the last. But it is the one I regret the most. The point I had wanted to make was the exact opposite of how it came out.\"  The comment led Clinton to headline a multi-day bus tour through virulently anti-Clinton areas in Kentucky, West Virginia and Ohio, leading to what became a hostile confrontation in Williamson, West Virginia, where several hundred protesters greeted her with \"Go home Hillary\" signs. \"I knew I wouldn't get a warm welcome in West Virginia,\" she writes. \"But this level of anger took me aback. This wasn't just about my comments in one town hall. This was about something different.\" Letting Comey go  Clinton would like a do over on her response to James Comey's July news conference, where the FBI director accused Clinton of being \"extremely careless\" in how she handled her emails. \"My first instinct was that my campaign should hit back hard and explain to the public that Comey had badly overstepped his bounds -- the same argument Rod Rosenstein would make months after the election,\" she writes, referencing the letter Trump's deputy attorney general wrote to justify firing Comey. Unnamed people on Clinton's team, however, \"raised concerns with that kind of confrontational approach,\" Clinton recalls. \"In the end, we decided it would be better to just let it go and try to move on,\" Clinton writes. \"Looking back, that was a mistake.\" Pushing back against the media Clinton has plenty of criticism for the media throughout this book, but she specifically cites NBC's Matt Lauer's performance during the Commander-in-Chief Forum in September 2016. Clinton mocks Lauer's focus on her use of a private email server for the bulk of the forum, moments before he would \"soft-pedal Trump's interview.\" \"Trump should have reported his performance as an in-kind contribution,\" Clinton writes. But the exchange also left Clinton regretting how she handled the moment. \"Here's another example where I remained polite, albeit exasperated, and played the political game as it used to be, not as it had become,\" she said of her decision not to confront Lauer on air. \"That was a mistake.\" 'Basket of deplorables'  Clinton writes that she handed Trump a \"political gift\" in September when she told an audience of supporters that \"you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.\" Her admission of a mistake isn't without equivocation, though.  Clinton writes that she was \"talking about well-documented reality,\" citing a 2016 study by the General Social Survey that found 55% of white Republicans \"believed that blacks are generally poorer than whites 'because most just don't have the motivation or willpower to pull themselves up and out of poverty.'\" \"Generalizing about a broad group of people is almost always unwise. And I regret handing Trump a political gift with my deplorables comments,\" Clinton writes. \"I know that a lot of well-intentioned people were insulted because they misunderstood me to be criticizing all Trump voters. I'm sorry about that.\"\n",
      "                             Bernie Sanders is warning Hillary Clinton against picking a moderate Democrat as her running mate.  But he's staying away from criticizing his rival over her private email use during her tenure as secretary of state, continuing to downplay an issue that Republicans have used heavily against Clinton. Still locked in a heated primary battle against Clinton, Sanders said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that she should find a vice-presidential pick who doesn't have a cozy relationship with corporations.  \"I would hope, if I am not the nominee, that the vice-presidential candidate will not be from Wall Street, will be somebody who has a history of standing up and fighting for working families, taking on the drug companies whose greed is doing so much harm, taking on Wall Street, taking on corporate America, and fighting for a government that works for all of us, not just the 1%,\" Sanders said.  The Vermont senator's vice-presidential prerequisites look like a list of his campaign's top talking points. But his comments also served to lay out terms for Sanders embracing Clinton if she secures the Democratic nomination at the party's convention in Philadelphia in July.  Host Chuck Todd asked Sanders specifically whether he'd support Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a former governor and Democratic National Committee chairman, for the vice-presidential nod.  Sanders wouldn't answer directly, saying: \"I think we are once again into a little bit of speculation. I have known Tim Kaine for years. I really like him very much.\" Asked whether he'd join Clinton as her running mate on a party unity ticket, Sanders said he's still \"knocking my brains out to win the Democratic nomination.\" \"That's where I am right now. What happens afterwards, we will see,\" Sanders said. \"But right now, my focus is on winning the nomination.\"  The final major set of primary contests, headlined by California, is coming up June 7.  But Sanders has focused much of his attention on Donald Trump in recent days -- hammering the presumptive Republican nominee while largely ignoring Clinton.  On Sunday, days after a State Department inspector general's report harshly criticized Clinton for her use of a private email server, Sanders again let the issue slide.  He'd sent a signal that he could be ready to hit Clinton over her email on Bill Maher's HBO show Friday, saying \"it has\" when asked if the story had \"moved a little bit\" from his initial refusal to criticize her on it, starting in last year's debates.   But on \"Meet the Press,\" asked about the report, Sanders said that \"these are areas that I have stayed away from. There is a process, people will draw their conclusions from the inspector general report. But again, you know, I think the American people are tired of that type of politics. And I think the media and the candidates have got to talk about why the middle class is in decline and why we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.\"  On CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Sanders went just a step further, saying Clinton's email issue merits a \"hard look\" but still stopping short of criticizing her for it.  \"Now, you're right -- the inspector general just came out with a report; it was not a good report for Secretary Clinton. That is something that the American people, Democrats and delegates are going to have to take a hard look at,\" he said. \"But for me right now, I continue to focus on how we can rebuild a disappearing middle class, deal with poverty, guarantee health care to all of our people as a right.\" \n",
      "                             During the 2016 campaign, Jeff Sessions called on then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch to recuse herself from the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and to appoint a special prosecutor in the case. The FoxNews.com op-ed, which was co-written with four other Donald Trump campaign surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani, specifically cited Lynch's meeting with former President Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix as grounds for her recusal. Sessions, now the attorney general, is facing calls from Democrats and Republicans to recuse himself from matters related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election after it was revealed on Wednesday that he did not disclose meetings last year with the Russian ambassador during his confirmation hearing. Sessions told Senators in his hearing he had not had any contacts with the Russians. \"Attorney General Lynch and former President Clinton met on the Phoenix, Arizona, tarmac days before Secretary Clinton was to be interviewed by the FBI for possible criminal activity,\" the November 2016 op-ed reads. The co-authors continued, \"General Lynch never recused herself from decisions on the Clinton investigation after her self-admitted 'mistake,' as it has also been reported that she continues to deny the FBI the authority to convene a grand jury, which is necessary for any meaningful investigation.\" \"Recusal is a formal process,\" the op-ed further said. \"It is a written document specifically describing the scope of the recusal and designating the official in charge of the recused matter. If General Lynch went through the proper procedure for recusal, she has not publicly shared it. \"Because of our grave concern for integrity in government we ask for a special counsel,\" the op-ed stated. \"When a high public official is accused of serious wrongdoing and there is a sufficient factual predicate to investigate, it is imperative the investigation be thorough, with dispatch and without partisanship.' A spokesperson for Sessions did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN about the op-ed.  Sessions was asked about his op-ed in a questionnaire submitted to him by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy. The questionnaire asked, \"By the recusal standard that you put forth in that op-ed, is it fair to expect you to recuse yourself from any matters regarding Mr. Trump or his finances?\" In his written response, Sessions said, \"There are significant differences between the issue discussed in the op-ed referenced above and the broad hypothetical presented regarding an investigation into the President. Secretary Clinton was under investigation at the time Attorney General Lynch met with President Clinton. If merely being a supporter of the President's during the campaign warranted recusal from involvement in any matter involving him, then most typical presidential appointees would be unable to conduct their duties.  \"I am not aware of a basis to recuse myself from such matters. If a specific matter arose where I believed my impartiality might reasonably be questioned, I would consult with Department ethics officials regarding the most appropriate way to proceed. As I made clear at my confirmation hearing, I will always be fair and work within the law and the established procedures of the Department.\"\n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton shrugged off calls Tuesday for more congressional inquiries into her email usage as nothing more than right-wing conspiracy pandering, saying that the FBI has \"resolved\" the matter. Clinton, speaking with her traveling press corps aboard her new campaign plane, said she has \"just accepted\" the fact that Republicans will continue to call for investigations into her. \"They are going to keep coming after me,\" Clinton said. \"The FBI resolved all of this, their report answered all the questions. Their findings included debunking his latest conspiracy theories.\" Clinton added, \"I believe I have created so many jobs in the sort of conspiracy theory machine factory. Because honestly, they never quit. They keep coming back.\" Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, called for an investigation into whether Clinton tried to impede Congress' initial investigation into her email server by deleting an archive of her emails. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Donald Trump's running mate, said Clinton deleting her emails before a congressional inquiry \"looks like obstruction,\" linking the incident to former President Richard Nixon, who was forced to resign from the office over the Watergate scandal. RELATED: Ryan: FBI played politics with release of Clinton probe details The FBI discovered during its investigation into Clinton's email use that Clinton's aides wiped her server with a sophisticated program known as BleachBit after the server was first reported in The New York Times. \"I don't know anything about that,\" Clinton said Monday. \"That was not something I was aware of and I think the fact point out that there was no connection. It wasn't something, as far as I understand, that was related.\" Asked on Tuesday if she was worried about Chaffetz's call and whether she asked for the emails to be deleted, Clinton flatly said, \"No, of course not.\" \"I have no concerns,\" Clinton said of the deletion. \"And neither did the FBI.\" RELATED: FBI director: Hillary Clinton 'extremely careless' but no charges recommended Clinton has spoken with reporters twice in the two days that she has had her campaign press plane, a pace that is far greater than any other time during her earlier time on the campaign trail. During a 23-minute question-and-answer session Tuesday, Clinton also sought to lower expectations around the first presidential debate held later this month and built up Trump's ability to debate. \"I am preparing for the debates. I am doing my homework. Donald Trump is a self-proclaimed great debater who won every one of the Republican debates. So I take nothing for granted,\" Clinton said. \"I think this will be a difficult, challenging debate.\" Clinton notably did not rule out going after Trump's personal life on the debate stage.  The former secretary of state added that she was not going to comment on whether Libertarian Gary Johnson should be able to get into the presidential debates. Some polls have shown that Johnson close to qualifying for the debate, but experts say it is unlikely that he will. A CNN poll released Tuesday found Johnson at 7%, well below the needed 15%. The same poll found that Trump lead Clinton nationally by 2%, within the poll's margin of error. Clinton dismissed the poll, saying she doesn't pay attention to the non-stop sampling. \"I really pay no attention to polls,\" Clinton said, adding, \"We are on a course that we are sticking with.\"\n",
      "                             The Department of Justice has granted \"immunity\" to a former State Department employee who worked on Hillary Clinton's private email server. Bryan Pagliano initially invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and would not testify. Of course, the Department of Justice, known to defense attorneys simply as the \"government,\" has many ways of getting people to talk.   The big question is whether there is a grand jury convened. The smart bet is yes. After all, the fact that there are immunity agreements logically means there's a grand jury investigation in some district. The grand jury is typically the genesis of the government's subpoena power. The next, bigger question, is whether anyone will be indicted.   The mere fact that the DOJ wants to talk to Pagliano does not mean anyone will be indicted. But if the DOJ is investigating criminal activity, they tend to find criminal activity. In general, when the government wants to talk to someone, the person falls into one of three categories: target, subject, or witness. If Pagliano was a \"target,\" that generally means the prosecutor or grand jury has significant evidence connecting the person to a crime. Targets routinely become defendants. A \"subject\" is a midrange status; this person is part of the investigation but not quite a target;  a precarious position to be in. A \"witness\" is a person who has valuable information, but is not (currently) believed to have committed a crime. However, \"witnesses\" matriculate up to \"targets\" very quickly, often because of the very information they provide.   For witnesses and defense attorneys alike, the decision whether or not to talk to the government is a difficult one. For the most part, there's a lot of risk, without a lot of upside.   There have been reports that the witness has been granted \"immunity.\" To many, that sounds like a good thing for Pagliano. After all, immunity means immunity, right? When does immunity not mean immunity?   Answer: it depends on the immunity. Consistent with the tradition of nebulous legalese, there are different kinds of immunity. \"Informal\" immunity is the brand preferred by U.S. Attorneys. It's a written letter agreement in which the particular U.S. Attorney's Office investigating and prosecuting the case (and only that office) promises to not charge the witness in exchange for the witness's truthful testimony.   The problem with this kind of \"letter\" immunity is the fine print. It's usually favorable to the government. For example, often the government can use derivative information. If your information leads to other information about the location of other evidence against you, that derivative information can be used against you?apart from the statement.  Additionally, if the government obtains information completely independent of the witness's testimony, it can prosecute the witness too.  Formal immunity, also called \"statutory\" immunity, is far more appealing to defendants. It offers more protection than letter immunity, and explicitly prohibits derivative use of the witness's testimony. As you can imagine, though, the government is notoriously miserly when it comes to negotiating or even offering immunity. Pagliano's exposure will depend on what he knows and did, but also on what specific kind of immunity deal he and his lawyers negotiated.   So former Clinton staffers the government wants to talk to have a number of tough decisions to make. First, they have to realistically evaluate their conduct, and assume, as with most cases, that the government knows far more than one might expect. Indeed, the government frequently knows more than the person they actually want to talk to. They are good at what they do; it's no accident that the federal conviction rate is well above 90%.    So, even if Pagliano honestly believes he did nothing wrong, that doesn't mean the government shares that view. If there's any potential liability, then the immunity agreement becomes critical.   Talking to the government, or giving a \"proffer,\" relinquishes the few advantages a defendant has: He gives up his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, and more, he gives the government the defense's version of the case up front.   While Pagliano is surely in an unenviable, nail-biting position, we can draw some inferences from recent events.  Whether he had zero potential liability, or some liability, he's probably not a \"target.\" Why? Because if he were, his attorney would probably not let him talk to the government, and the government would probably not give him immunity.  Remember, the government is parsimonious with immunity deals. Another, less reliable inference may be drawn not about Pagliano, but others who are not Pagliano.   The person who often has to worry the most during this process is the person who hasn't been approached at all by the government. That's a chilling indicator that you may be the target.

      "                             Donald Trump lit into Hillary Clinton on trade at the start of the first presidential debate, hammering away at a policy area that has both haunted Clinton and helped Trump's brand during the 2016 campaign.  As the candidates discussed their respective economic plans, Trump blamed former President Bill Clinton for signing NAFTA, referring to it as the \"worst thing that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.\" Then, Trump went after Clinton herself on a key vulnerability: \"And now you want to approve (the) Trans-Pacific Partnership.\" The exchange over the massive trade deal, which involved the candidates talking over each other and hurling accusations, was one of the most explosive of the evening and marked the spirited return of a political issue that was a prominent feature of the primary season.  Trump noted that Clinton had once favored the trade pact before coming out against it.  \"That is just not accurate,\" Clinton shot back. \"I was against it once it was fully negotiated and the terms were laid out.\" \"You called it the gold standard. You called it the gold standard of trade deals,\" Trump said, recalling a description Clinton once used while the trade deal was being negotiated.  \"Donald, I know you live in your own reality but that is not the facts,\" Clinton said -- a jab alluding to Trump's past involvement in reality TV. \"I said I hoped it would be a good deal ... I concluded it wasn't.\" Trump cut in to ask multiple times: \"So it is President Obama's fault?\" RELATED: Trump, Clinton clash in debate showdown Clinton was criticized for flip-flopping on her past support for TPP throughout the primaries when she ran against liberal Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. She came out against the deal after she started running for president and as she faced pressure from progressives to oppose what many Americans fear would take jobs away from the United States.  Trump, meanwhile, has been very vocal during this election in his opposition of TPP -- a position that has helped the businessman boost his populist economic message and win over working-class voters.  Trade wasn't the only topic that made the two nominees testy, however.  When NBC's Lester Holt, the debate moderator, brought up the issue of Trump's tax returns, the billionaire gave his usual answer: that his tax returns are current under audit. He said that he would release his tax returns if Clinton \"releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted.\" Clinton kept the emails on a private server she used as secretary of state that was later destroyed. She jumped at the opportunity to slam her opponent for refusing to release his taxes, something that has been customary for presidential nominees for years.  \"You've got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?\" Clinton said, suggesting that Trump may not be as wealthy or charitable as he claims. \"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes.\" \"There's something he's hiding!\" Clinton alleged.  When Holt asked Clinton to address the email scandal, she offered a short and succinct answer: that she had made a mistake and would do things differently if she had the opportunity.  \"That was more than a mistake,\" Trump shot back. \"That was not a mistake. That was done purposefully.\" When the debate turned to the sensitive issue of race and politics, Trump boasted that he had recently visited places like Detroit and Philadelphia. \"I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home,\" Trump said to Clinton.  Clinton responded: \"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did. And you know hat else I prepared for? I prepared to be president, and I think that's a good thing.\" Trump repeated multiple factually inaccurate statements during Monday's debate, including the assertion that he had opposed the Iraq War.  But one claim in particular drew a particularly sharp rebuke from Clinton: that it was her 2008 campaign that had fueled the so-called \"birther\" movement. Trump has for years repeated the allegation that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, and only recently acknowledged that the president was born in the country.  Clinton charged that Trump had spread a \"racist lie.\" These comments likely foreshadowed an argument that Clinton will continue to make as she attempts to capitalize on the perception of a majority of voters who view Trump as appealing to bigotry.  \"He tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. But it can't be dismissed that easily,\" Clinton said.\n",
      "                             Debbie Wasserman Schultz's stewardship of the Democratic National Committee has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process.  Now, on the eve of the party's convention, Wasserman Schultz is facing pressure to resign, and will have no major role on the convention stage, after Wikileaks released nearly 20,000 DNC emails that bolster Sanders' supporters' claims that the party favored Clinton.  One email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Bernie Sanders' faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters. Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Hillary Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreement. Here's what you need to know about the DNC email leak so far: Emails leaked from seven DNC officials The leaks, from January 2015 to May 2016, feature Democratic staffers debating everything from how to deal with challenging media requests to coordinating the committee's message with other powerful interests in Washington.  The emails were leaked from the accounts of seven DNC officials, Wikileaks said. CNN has not independently established the emails' authenticity. The emails could boost Sanders supporters' charge that the DNC was biased toward Clinton -- a position Sanders himself underscored when he endorsed Wasserman Schultz's primary opponent in her Florida congressional race.  But Baltimore mayor and DNC Secretary Stephanie Rawlings-Blake denied any suggestion that Clinton's camp was treated more favorably by the committee. \"My expectation is beyond your opinion about a candidate, that you act evenly. All of the officers took a pledge of neutrality and I honored that, and I take that very seriously,\" Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Poppy Harlow. She added: \"I know that the chair will hold those employees accountable if they're found to have acted outside of that neutrality and even-handedness.\" Asked about the exchanges, Rawlings-Blake said: \"Expressing an opinion about a candidate doesn't mean that you're in collusion, doesn't mean that you are actively working against them. And I don't think that that's what it shows.\" Questioning Sanders' faith One email features DNC staffers appearing to ponder ways to undercut Sanders, an insurgent Democrat who had a bitter relationship with party leadership.  DNC hack: What you need to know On May 5, a DNC employee asked colleagues to \"get someone to ask his belief\" in God and suggested that it could make a difference in Kentucky and West Virginia. Sanders' name is not mentioned in the note. \"This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist,\" DNC chief financial officer Brad Marshall wrote. Marshall did not respond to a request for comment.  Clinton prods DNC for intervention In another email, an attorney for the Clinton campaign appears to advise the DNC on how to respond to a dispute between the two campaigns over how much money Clinton's operation had raised for state parties. Sanders' campaign charged that Clinton's team was not handing over its fair share of its fundraising, which Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver said was \"laundering\" and \"looting.\" \"My suggestion is that the DNC put out a statement saying that the accusations the Sanders campaign are not true. The fact that CNN notes that you aren't getting between the two campaigns is the problem,\" Marc E. Elias wrote. \"Here, Sanders is attacking the DNC and its current practice, its past practice with the POTUS and with Sec Kerry. Just as the RNC pushes back directly on Trump over 'rigged system,' the DNC should push back DIRECTLY at Sanders and say that what he is saying is false and harmful (to) the Democratic party.\" Elias and the Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. Favoring bigger donors Another exchange involves a discussion on whether to move Maryland ophthalmologist Sreedhar Potarazu from sitting beside President Barack Obama at a DNC event after National Finance Director Jordan Kaplan said he gave less money than Philip Munger, another donor. \"It would be nice to take care of him from the DNC side,\" Kaplan wrote, referring to Munger. Potarazu told CNN Saturday that he wants answers from top DNC officials on how they are responding to these revelations, which have surfaced days before the Democratic convention. \"I was obviously shocked to see my name in the middle of all of this because I'm just an innocent bystander,\" he said. \"I'm curious to see what's happening at the highest levels of the DNC right now,\" he added. \"I don't know, but I'm sure it's a fire drill. The timing is not good.\" Wasserman Schultz attacks Weaver Wasserman Shultz also called Weaver a \"damn liar\" in May after he criticized the Nevada Democratic Party following protests among Sanders supporters who said Clinton's backers had subverted party rules. They shouted down pro-Clinton speakers and sent threatening messages to state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange after posting her phone number and address on social media.  \"The state party there has a lot of problems. They've run things very poorly. It has been done very undemocratically,\" Weaver said on CNN in May. \"And there seems to be an unwillingness on the part of the Nevada Democratic Party to bring in all of the new people that Bernie Sanders has brought into the process.\" The DNC chair responded in an email: \"Damn liar. Particularly scummy that he barely acknowledges the violent and threatening behavior that occurred.\" And in an email quoting Weaver as saying, \"I think we should go to the convention,\" Wasserman Shultz wrote: \"He is an ASS.\" Trump's response: 'RIGGED' Republican nominee Donald Trump, however, said the emails were proof of the Democrats' \"rigged\" system, resurfacing an attack he's leveled against the party before. \"Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED,\" Trump tweeted Saturday morning. \n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton is back in the middle of an unfolding controversy. The revelation that as secretary of state she maintained a private email account, and that she had a private computer server in her New York home, sent shock waves through the world of politics last week. Questions arose about whether Clinton conducted her official business on private email, possibly violating regulations that were written to ensure that the activities of government officials remain accessible to the public.  Republicans jumped on the story. \"It makes you wonder,\" said Reince Preibus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. \"Did she use the private emails so she could conduct diplomacy and fund-raising at the same time?\" Even many Democrats are worried about the implications of this recent story. Their front-runner, their \"inevitable\" nominee for 2016, now seems vulnerable. Many in Washington are anticipating that the scandal is only getting started. This is not the first time that Hillary Clinton has found herself in this situation. She has spent much of her political career battling scandals. When her husband, Bill Clinton, was president of the United States, she was one of the first targets of the earliest investigations into the administration -- \"Travel-gate,\" \"File-gate\" and the Whitewater affair. She stood by her husband's side later in his presidency when House Republicans moved to impeach him for having lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. Although Clinton enjoyed a bit of a break when serving in the Senate, the controversies resumed once she became secretary of state under President Obama.  During her tenure, Republicans became consumed with multiple investigations into her role in the tragic Benghazi attacks. Although the investigations failed to find any evidence of wrongdoing, the issue became a rallying point for conservative activists and fund-raisers. Some Republicans now claim that the emails will provide the data that they have been looking for to prove what they were saying. But those observers who are predicting her demise  should remember that Hillary Clinton has proven to be remarkably resilient over the years. Each time she or her family has been hit with a scandal, she has survived. She has proven to be an extraordinarily tough fighter who turns these challenges into opportunities to become stronger. As Kate McKinnon, playing Hillary Clinton on \"Saturday Night Live\" said, \"Nice try. ... This is NOT how Hillary Clinton goes down.\" Based on her history, what can we expect from the Clinton scandal playbook? Attack the accuser and the investigative process: Nobody has done this better than Hillary Clinton. When her husband first confronted charges about his affair, Clinton famously went on television and spoke about a \"right-wing conspiracy\" that she claimed was driving the scandal. Although the revelation that the affair did occur brought her family great embarrassment, her charge became part of a larger counterattack from the administration that proved to be extremely effective.  The Clintons zeroed in on the hyperpartisanship of some members of the GOP, such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich, claiming that the Republicans in Congress were on a mission to pull off a political coup. She employed a similar strategy with the Benghazi investigations, arguing that the inquiry was more a political tool used to rally the base than a serious investigation. We are likely to hear similar arguments now, particularly since the email controversy has opened up right as the campaign season is taking off. As more Republicans can't resist jumping on the issue, Clinton will push back, focusing public attention less on the issue than on the idea that this is part of a political narrative to bring her down. Stick it out: One thing that Hillary Clinton and her husband understand well is that the news media love a good scandal feeding frenzy, but that soon enough reporters move on. The American public, which is now used to fast-paced and constantly changing news stories, will follow the coverage as it shifts to a new story even after weeks, or months, of attention on one single issue. Remember the Ebola crisis? Not many people do, though for a time it was all anyone was talking about. As Brendan Nyhan wrote in The New York Times: \"If there's one thing we've learned from past presidential campaigns, it's that most supposed game-changers like this quickly fade from the memory of the political class, having never been noticed by most Americans in the first place.\"  When dealing with scandal, Hillary Clinton and her husband have avoided taking any rash action, ignoring whispers about resignation or discussions about major apologies. Instead they strike back against their opponents and wait out the news cycle until the frenzy dies down. People should not expect Clinton to do anything drastic in the near future. Her first move, via Twitter, was to announce in straightforward fashion that she has asked the State Department to review and release some of the email as soon as possible. While some Democrats are champing at the bit to use this opportunity to push other members of their party (Elizabeth Warren!) into the political fray, Clinton is not going to give them any space to do this. She will wait until reporters and Congress move in a different direction. Rally the party base: If there is one thing that the Clintons understand, it is that their party is desperate for a good fight. After years of dealing with congressional Republicans and the hardball tactics of conservative activists, the Clintons appreciate that members of their party are searching for leaders who will take on their opponents.  Democrats are tired of elected officials who roll over too easily when attacked by Republicans. This has been one of the major complaints from Democrats about Obama. Even when many Democrats were furious with the White House following the Monica Lewinsky revelation, the Clintons appealed to partisan instincts and rallied the troops to fight for them as a way to push back against the GOP. By 1998, they had transformed the issue from being about Clinton and perjury to a struggle to protect the Democratic Party. Clinton will do this again. Democrats are feeling particularly vulnerable ever since former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush entered the race, bringing star power to a GOP campaign that seemed filled with lightweights and flawed candidates. Given that Democrats feel the stakes are enormously high to keep control of the White House so that the next president can protect Obama's programs from Republican attack, Clinton will appeal to that instinct to carry her through. Will it work? That remains to be seen. It will depend on the scale and scope of the upcoming revelations and what her opponents decide to do with the material. But the Clinton playbook is pretty clear and road-tested. If Clinton's critics and opponents expect her to just roll over, they really haven't been studying their history.

      "                             Some of Hillary Clinton's closest aides, including her longtime adviser Huma Abedin, have provided interviews to federal investigators, as the FBI probe into the security of her private email server nears completion, U.S. officials briefed on the investigation tell CNN.  The investigation is still ongoing, but so far investigators haven't found evidence to prove that Clinton willfully violated the law the U.S. officials say.   In recent weeks, multiple aides have been interviewed -- some more than once, the officials said. A date for an FBI interview of Clinton has not been set, these officials said, but is expected in the coming weeks. Abedin has cooperated with the probe, the officials said.  Lawyers for Abedin declined to comment.  The officials say the interviews of Clinton and her aides would be a routine part of an investigation like this. The Clinton campaign said Thursday that they've cooperated with the Justice Department review since the beginning. \"From the start, Hillary Clinton has offered to answer any questions that would help the Justice Department complete its review, and we hope and expect that anyone else who is asked would do the same. We are confident the review will conclude that nothing inappropriate took place,\" Clinton's press secretary Brian Fallon said in a statement. The probe remains focused on the security of the server and the handling of classified information and hasn't expanded to other matters, the officials said. Spokesmen for the FBI and Justice Department declined to comment.  David Kendall, an attorney for Clinton, had no comment.  CNN has previously reported that another former Clinton employee, Bryan Pagliano, who helped set up the server has provided documents and other materials as well as interviews to the FBI, under an immunity agreement.  FBI officials overseeing the probe now expect to complete their work in the next few weeks and then turn over the findings to the Justice Department, which will make a final decision on whether to bring charges against anyone.  Prosecutors from the Justice Department's national security division and from the U.S. Attorney's office in Alexandria, Va., have helped coordinate the FBI probe, closely overseeing investigative steps, the U.S. officials say.  One of the final and most anticipated steps in the probe is an interview of the former secretary of state. The fact that Clinton is a presidential candidate active on the campaign trail presents some logistical challenges for the FBI, which has been quietly bringing witnesses into an FBI office without drawing attention.  Clinton's security is provided by the Secret Service and she's typically followed by a corps of campaign reporters. The FBI plans to coordinate her interview with her attorneys and security to try to ensure it can be done privately.   In addition, this week, a notorious hacker awaiting trial claimed he infiltrated Clinton's server but law enforcement officials said the FBI investigation into Guccifer found no sign he got into the Clinton server according to law enforcement sources. \n",
      "                             The National Archives is the keeper of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence -- and the agency charged with preserving and organizing government records like Hillary Clinton's emails during her tenure as secretary of state. Outside its Washington, D.C. headquarters is \"The Future,\" a 1935 Robert Aitken sculpture of a woman seated, holding an open book, over the inscription, \"What is Past is Prologue.\" It is a classic line from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" -- and the Golden Rule for any Clinton watcher. Secrecy. Shielding documents. Accusations of arrogance and hypocrisy. Debates about the letter and the spirit of the rules. A public defense -- but also jitters and disbelief -- from fellow Democrats. Legitimate criticism along with some eye-rolling conspiracy theories from Republicans. READ: Hillary Clinton says she used one email 'for convenience' We have seen this movie before. The latest episode is the tempest this past week over Hillary Clinton's decision to use a private email account -- and a personal server located in her home -- instead of an official State Department account. From her first days at Foggy Bottom,  Secretary Clinton said she did not want the hassle of multiple email accounts, and told her staff to figure it out.  That decision was made despite direction from her boss - President Obama - that administration officials should use official email accounts. It also came despite his - and her - promises of improved government transparency. And despite her 2007 criticism of Bush administration use of \"secret White House email accounts.\"  READ: Hillary Clinton's email excuse won't quiet critics Why didn't someone on her team push back, and insist Secretary Clinton reconsider? Flashback to January 1996. Writing in The New York Times, reporter David Johnston wrote of Mrs. Clinton's secretive role in the firings of White House travel office staffers and, significantly,  \"a climate of fear in which officials did not dare question Mrs. Clinton's wishes.\" What is past is prologue. Then, and now, Clinton loyalists describe shortcuts taken on her behalf as inadvertent and innocent.  For convenience, they say, not protection. Clinton critics, then and now, see cutthroat use of power and a trademark penchant for control and secrecy.  Her camp's response to the email controversy so far is textbook Clinton crisis management: say -- and do -- as little as possible, just enough to keep inevitable controversy from ballooning into unpredictable crisis.  READ: Hillary Clinton donors frustrated by email controversy The White House is annoyed because the President was forced to answer questions about the issue before Secretary Clinton said anything, and several Democrats over the weekend suggesting silence was not a wise strategy. Most loyalists expect Secretary Clinton to offer a public explanation soon, and believe this will soon pass. But these loyalists are watching closely to see if the old playbook still works. Times and technology have changed considerably in the fifteen years since the Clintons lived in the White House. \"Transparency and authenticity matter more now,\" one Clinton confidante said. GOP veterans of the 1990s warn against Republican overreach. Yes, there are now several legitimate avenues for congressional oversight in which the presumptive 2016 Democratic nominee as Exhibit A. There are new subpoenas issued by the select committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks to a likely broader GOP review of government record-keeping and email practices. The Republican worry is that the GOP will somehow turn a gift into a backlash by letting the party's long-festering Clinton animus steer the political response beyond the facts, and good taste. READ: 8 oddities of Hillary Clinton's email presser Talk of possible criminal violations -- from GOPers like Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Darell Issa -- delight a conservative base that believes Mrs. Clinton long has skirted the rules but escaped accountability. Remember the Rose Law Firm records, they ask? Years after investigators were told they were no where to be found, the documents turned up in a storage closet in the White House residence.  And remember, this conservative narrative goes, Hillary Clinton is the only first lady in history to be fingerprinted - during the Whitewater investigation when other records long characterized as missing turned up in the Clintons' personal quarters at the White House.   Talk of possible law breaking now and trips down Clinton memory lane give some pause to GOP elder statesmen who have watched past Clinton crises somehow inflict as much if not more harm on Republicans.  A longtime Republican strategist described questions about her private email server as a legitimate political issue \"because this follows a Clinton pattern of behavior.\"  But, mindful of past Republican overreach, this GOP veteran said his hope was that prominent Republicans show caution, remember history and realize the best approach might be that  \"we just sit back and watch.\"   \n",
      "                             Today, the world's most boring political scandal reached an unsatisfying conclusion: Hilary Clinton has been cleared of criminal liability for allegations she mishandled classified information by using a private email server when she was the secretary of state. Why is it unsatisfying?  Because it confirms everything that we hate about the current state of politics.  There are no winners today, only losers: the American public. The FBI director, James Comey, appeared to be frustrated -- and fuming -- at the press conference where he announced the findings.  It was a beat-down, even though he was backing away from an indictment. After an investigation that lasted longer than a year, a review of more than 30,000 emails and interviews with more than a dozen people, the decision not to formally charge Clinton came down to this, he said: \"In looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts,\" he said. Past prosecutions, he said, generally involved \"clearly intentional and willful mishandling,\" \"vast quantities of materials,\" or \"indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice.\"   Remember four-star Gen. David Petraeus who went down on similar charges?  He pleaded guilty to mishandling classified information.  That was a very different case for sure: He intentionally gave confidential material to a journalist he was sleeping with and then lied to the FBI about it.   Clinton and her aides used a nongovernment email server, there was no breach that we know of and she cooperated with the FBI. As Comey said: \"In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. ... We do not see those things here,\" he said. Which is why they are \"expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case.\" But if you listen closely, there's something bigger at stake than a conviction and a fine: There is the election. The FBI basically just called the story Clinton has been telling the public since 2015 a bunch of nonsense.  Contrary to what Clinton has been saying, the server did in fact contain classified emails: 113 of them.  Her actions did in fact expose the classified information to attacks by \"hostile actors.\"  As Comey said, \"any reasonable person ... should have known that an unclassified system was no place\" for that sort of information.  And Clinton and her team did delete emails that contained classified information.  Those are facts, and they contradict what Clinton and her team have been saying.  Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. The head of the FBI slammed Clinton and her team as \"extremely careless.\"  I think it's worse; I think she's extremely clueless about the bigger picture. In law school, we often talked about the letter of the law versus the spirit of the law.  She may not have violated the letter of the law (although there's debate there, too) but she sure as hell violated the spirit of it.  And that plays right into her biggest challenge in the election -- herself. She's not like Donald Trump.  He seems to be able to say anything (\"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters\") and we dismiss it because Trump just \"says what he feels.\"  He has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits.  And where is the evidence that voters care? Where are the investigations of Trump? Who holds him accountable for battles he's lost in court or the number of small business owners that allege he uses aggressive and strong-arm tactics to rip off vendors? In 30 years, no major U.S. company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trump's casino empire, but that doesn't seem to scandalize voters. This isn't an endorsement for Clinton, it's a perspective check for us all.  Optics, not substance, are everything in American politics and it's clear who's winning and who's losing.  Some more perspective?  A Public Policy Research Poll found that 13% of Americans say that if the choices for president were Clinton, Trump, and a giant meteor hitting the Earth, they'd go with the meteor. Still, Clinton isn't Trump.  Issues don't roll off her, they stick to her like cement and this one could very well sink her.   If Trump wins the election it'll be for one reason, people didn't like Hillary Clinton. And despite polling guru Nate Silver's prediction that she'll win, she could very well lose for two reasons.  Many people believe she's not \"trustworthy\" and that she and her husband act as though the rules don't apply.  The reason is that she appears to use the \"letter of the law\" as a shield, when what the public cares about is the spirit of the law.   In referencing a dozen \"vaguely worded\" emails about a planned CIA drone strike in Pakistan, Comey admonished Clinton, who \"should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.\"  What he's really saying is that she did know it was no place for that conversation but she did it anyway.   Her own aides said in sworn testimony that they gave little to no thought about the problem of using a private email server.  And why would they worry about the rules, if \"technically\" they weren't meaning to break them? Hillary Clinton may have escaped all criminal liability, but there's no doubt in my mind she just increased the political kind.  \n",
      "                             FBI Director James Comey is defending the bureau's Friday afternoon release of documents from the Hillary Clinton email investigation, saying \"we don't play games\" and that the documents were put out when ready. In a memo to employees Wednesday, Comey said the decision to not recommend charges against the now-Democratic nominee wasn't a close call.  Read Comey's full memo \"At the end of the day, the case itself was not a cliff-hanger; despite all the chest-beating by people no longer in government, there really wasn't a prosecutable case,\" he said in the memo.  In recent weeks, Comey has met with groups of former FBI agents as part of his routine visits to field offices around the country. In at least one recent such meeting, according to people familiar with the meeting, former agents were sharply critical of the FBI's handling of the Clinton probe and particularly the decision to not recommend charges against Clinton. Comey gave the meeting participants a similar answer about the case not being a cliff-hanger.   Comey said he briefly considered holding the documents until after the Labor Day holiday, knowing that the Friday afternoon release would likely prompt criticism. He also said more document releases are coming.  \"I almost ordered the material held until Tuesday because I knew we would take all kinds of grief for releasing it before a holiday weekend, but my judgment was that we had promised transparency and it would be game-playing to withhold it from the public just to avoid folks saying stuff about us,\" Comey said.   \"We don't play games. So we released it Friday. We are continuing to process more material and will release batches of documents as they are ready, no matter the day of the week,\" Comey said. He concluded the memo by writing, \"Those suggesting that we are 'political' or part of some 'fix' either don't know us, or they are full of baloney (and maybe some of both).\" On Tuesday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan criticized the FBI's handling of the matter, accusing the bureau of playing politics with the release. \"It's like the most buried time you could ever put out a story. I'm surprised. I can't believe that they would do what is such a patently political move. It makes them look like political operators versus law enforcement officers,\" Ryan said in a radio interview with WRJN's Glenn Klein.\n",
      "                             Emails released by the Pentagon late Friday show Defense Secretary Ash Carter continued to occasionally use a personal account for official business through September, months after controversy erupted over Hillary Clinton's email use while leading the State Department. Some 1,336 pages of emails from his use of email on an iPhone and tablet were released to CNN and other news organizations pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request. Many of the emails had redacted information. Some showed him talking with aides about various matters, including press requests, while others included him exchanging messages with friends or acquaintances, including several with Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. Carter has said he never used personal devices to transmit classified information. A couple of the emails just released were marked \"for official use only,\" which means the material is considered sensitive but is not deemed classified. RELATED: Ashton Carter used personal email for some government business The issue of email practices became controversial a year ago when it was revealed that Clinton only used a personal email account to conduct official business during her time in office.   Carter used a government email account for the majority of his work. He apologized in December after The New York Times first reported he had used a private email account for some official business. At the time, he said he had stopped using his personal email for official business a few months prior. The release of this batch of emails shows he continued using the account through September -- four months after the revelations regarding Clinton and her email practices. \"In December, when this issue first came up, the secretary took responsibility for his actions and publicly acknowledged that his previous use of personal email for work-related business was a mistake. As a result, he stopped such use of his personal email and further limited his use of email altogether,\" Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said in a statement. \"While still acknowledging the mistake, the emails released today again show that he did not email anything classified and all of his work-related emails are preserved within the federal records system.\" In December, Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain criticized Carter's use of personal email. \"With all the public attention surrounding the improper use of personal email by other administration officials, it is hard to believe that Secretary Carter would exercise the same error in judgment,\" McCain said in a statement. The Pentagon has banned the use of personal email for official business since 2012. Administration officials have said President Barack Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, became aware of Carter's use of personal email last May and had asked White House lawyers to contact the Pentagon to make sure the appropriate policy was being followed.\n",
      "                             Jane Pauley asked Hillary Clinton a simple question during a sitdown on CBS' \"Sunday Morning\": Were there mistakes she made that led to her loss in the 2016 presidential race? Clinton's response was telling. \"I think the -- the most important of the mistakes I made was using personal email,\" Clinton acknowledged. \"I've said it before, I'll say it again, that was my responsibility. It was presented in such a really negative way, and I never could get out from under it. And it never stopped.\" She's (sort of) right. There's no question that the decision -- during Clinton's early days at the State Department -- to exclusively use a private email address/server was a massive mistake.  Not only was she the first secretary of state to exclusively use a private email address (others, like Colin Powell, had used both a private email and an official state.gov address) but the decision to use her own private server reinforced many of the negative perceptions people had about Clinton. Clinton already carried loads of baggage into the race from her husband's two terms as President. Among the pieces of baggage: People thought the Clintons thought the rules didn't apply to them.\n",
      "                             Rep. Sean Duffy said Wednesday there is no need for Donald Trump to prosecute Hillary Clinton because the American public already has already made its decision about her. \"I think that the American people, in regard to the email server -- we had a big American jury trial in this election and Mrs. Clinton lost,\" the Wisconsin Republican and Trump supporter told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day.\" \"She's been called out for her bad acts with the server.\" During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the former secretary of state after the FBI and Justice Department decided against prosecuting Clinton for her use of a private email server while serving in the Obama administration.  Trump supporters embraced this plan often chanting \"lock her up!\" at his rallies and Trump interrupted Clinton during the second presidential debate to say if he were president, \"You'd be in jail.\" But now the President-elect said he won't push for prosecution of his former rival, telling The New York Times that she has \"suffered greatly.\" Duffy agreed that Clinton has been through enough. \"At what point, we can say is that enough. Did we get our pound of flesh on her? I think so,\" he said. \"Let's set this one aside. The investigation has already taken place. Let's move forward in making America great again.\" If the Trump administration is going to effectively accomplish the President-elect's agenda, he can't be tied up with prosecuting Clinton, Duffy argued. \"If you're going to actually get the big things done that are going to help grow our economy and put these middle (class) Americans that have been left behind back to work, you can't have a big massive big fight with Mrs. Clinton,\" he said. \n",
      "                             Filmmaker Michael Moore said Thursday that Democrats should not focus solely on the FBI's handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server as the reason why they lost the White House.  \"Democrats are doing themselves a disservice if they just focus on the Comey thing and not on all the other reasons this happened,\" Moore told CNN's Don Lemon on \"CNN Tonight with Don Lemon.\" Thursday, the Justice Department inspector general said he was looking into the FBI's decision to reopen the investigation into Clinton's private email server, just days before the election. Democrats say that move contributed to Clinton's loss. But Moore, a Clinton supporter, suggested the investigation was just part of the picture. \"Obviously, this had an impact in the final week of the election,\" Moore said. \"It's not the only thing though. It's disgraceful that twice in 16 years the Democrats have won the popular vote and somehow lost the electoral college. That they would let this happened again. That nobody did the math, nobody thought this out, everybody knew what the law was. Hillary didn't go to Wisconsin for seven months.\"  Lemon highlighted two CNN Poll of Polls taken towards the latter part of the campaign, showing a Clinton lead that was cut in half after the release of a letter from FBI Director James Comey to lawmakers announcing the discovery of emails potentially relevant to its investigation of Clinton's handling of classified information.  Comey did announce just two days before the election that, based on the FBI's review of emails, the agency had not changed its findings that Clinton should not face criminals charges. Democrats remained outraged and said Comey's actions stalled Clinton's momentum in the final days of the campaign.   \"I don't think people all of sudden decided, who were going to vote for Hillary, 'I am going to now vote for Trump',\" Moore said. \"I think it depressed the vote for Hillary.  A lot of people threw their hands up and said 'I'm not voting. I am staying home.' And it energized certain people who maybe weren't that excited about Trump but said I have heard enough of this. I don't want another 8 years of Clinton-o-rama, so I am going to go out and vote for Trump.\"\n",
      "                             Newly released emails from Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state raise questions about the nature of the department's relationship with the Clinton Foundation. Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, released 296 pages of emails from the Democratic presidential nominee, including 44 that Judicial Watch says were not previously handed over to the State Department by Clinton. The emails, many of which are heavily redacted, raise questions about the Clinton Foundation's influence on the State Department and its relations during her tenure.  In one instance, top Clinton Foundation official Doug Band lobbied Clinton aides for a job for someone else in the State Department. In the email, Band tells Hillary Clinton's former aides at the department -- Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin -- that it is \"important to take care of (redacted).\" Band is reassured by Abedin that \"Personnel has been sending him options.\"  The emails were obtained by the group through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch against the State Department in 2015. The group did not respond to a CNN request for comment. The Trump campaign seized at the new batch of emails, citing them as evidence of Clinton being corrupt. The prolonged investigations into her use of a private email server while at the State Department has fueled public distrust of her and plagued her presidential bid. But the Justice Department declined to press charges against Clinton for her handling of classified information related to the server earlier this year, with FBI Director James Comey saying while she was \"extremely careless,\" it was his judgment that \"no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\"  In a 2009 email, Band directs Abedin and Mills to put Gilbert Chagoury, a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and Clinton Foundation donor, in contact with the State Department's \"substance person\" on Lebanon. \"We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person re Lebanon,\" Band wrote. \"As you know, he's a key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon. Very imp.\" \"It's jeff feltman,\" Abedin responded, referring to Jeffrey Feltman, who was the US ambassador to Lebanon at the time. \"I'm sure he knows him. I'll talk to jeff.\" Feltman told CNN Wednesday that he never met with Chagoury.  \"I have never met nor spoken with Mr Chagoury. I was not aware of the proposal that he speak to me until this email exchange was released, but in any case we never spoke,\" he said. Judicial Watch President Tom Filton said in a press release that Clinton \"hid\" the 44 emails on purpose. \"No wonder Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin hid emails from the American people, the courts and Congress,\" he said in a press release. \"They show the Clinton Foundation, Clinton donors, and operatives worked with Hillary Clinton in potential violation of the law.\" Clinton defense Clinton's campaign said the emails didn't relate to her work at the Clinton Foundation. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up \"Neither of these emails involve the secretary or relate to the Foundation's work,\" said an emailed statement from Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin. \"They are communications between her aides and the President's personal aide, and indeed the recommendation was for one of the Secretary's former staffers who was not employed by the Foundation.\" The Clinton campaign said Wednesday that Chagoury only wanted to offer insights on the then-upcoming Lebanese election and was not looking for any specific action from the State Department.  \"The right-wing organization behind this lawsuit has been attacking the Clintons since the 1990s and no matter how this group tries to mischaracterize these documents, the fact remains that Hillary Clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the Clinton Foundation,\" Schwerin said in a statement. Trump response GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump sought to use the emails to paint Clinton as corrupt.  \"This is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment, character, stability and temperament to be within 1,000 miles of public power,\" said Stephen Miller, Trump's national policy director. \"She views public office as nothing more than a means to personal enrichment -- and every dollar she takes comes at the expense of the public welfare. This latest finding is an unseemly, disturbing window into a corrupt office, and yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton has been lying from the beginning -- and by any reasonable definition attempted to obstruct the investigation of the FBI.\"  Trump also tweeted: \"When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Wednesday that if the State Department doesn't release all of the remaining Clinton emails by November it will prove the system is \"rigged\" -- a line Trump has used recently. \"Anything less than a full release of these public records before voting begins will only further prove that we have a rigged system that has one set of rules political elites and another for everyone else,\" Priebus said in a statement. Server investigation On Wednesday, Judicial Watch released written testimony from Mills, in which she provides further detail on how Clinton's private email server was set up to address potentially security concerns. Mills told the attorneys she spoke with a Clinton IT staffer in 2013, after learning the email account of a close Clinton confidante, Sidney Blumenthal, had been compromised by a hacker. \"As I recall, these discussions involved whether this event might affect Secretary Clinton's email,\" Mills said in follow-up answers to an earlier deposition given to Judicial Watch. Mills also said she recalls speaking to the same staffer -- Bryan Pagliano -- about the company overseeing the server set up. \"As I recall, these discussions involved whether Platte River Networks would have the technical capacity and be the appropriate source from which to gather Secretary Clinton's email from the clintonemail.com system,\" Mills said. Early this year as the investigation into Clinton's private email server was in full swing, several FBI field offices approached the Justice Department asking to open a case regarding the relationship between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation, according to a law enforcement official.  At the time, DOJ declined because it had looked into allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation around a year earlier and found there wasn't sufficient evidence to open a case. In a hearing last month on Capitol Hill, FBI Director James Comey declined to say whether the Clinton Foundation was under investigation, saying: \"I'm not going to comment on the existence or non-existence of any investigation.\" For there to be criminal conflict of interest there would have to be evidence showing a government employee received something of value in exchange, such as a job post-employment or money. There doesn't appear to be anything so far suggesting that in the newly released, heavily redacted emails from Judicial Watch. But those emails do raise questions about whether the relationship between the State Department and Clinton Foundation was too cozy, particularly after Clinton pledged she would not be involved with the foundation when she became secretary of state, in an effort to prevent an inappropriate relationship. In a case where there's a possible conflict of interest that's not necessarily criminal, the inspector general can look into it and take an administrative remedy if necessary. The State Department OIG has been looking into connections between the State Department and Clinton during her term as secretary of state since earlier this year, but has not said anything about the matter.  The Clinton Foundation has repeatedly said it is not being investigated.   On Tuesday, the Clinton campaign said there is nothing to suggest foul play, and Clinton had nothing to do with the newly released emails. The campaign has said in the past the Clintons don't take a salary from the foundation and all their income is disclosed.  A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.\n",
      "                             Donald Trump on Friday challenged President Barack Obama to pledge not to issue a presidential pardon to Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server while leading the State Department. Clinton, however, has been cleared of any criminal wrongdoing by the FBI and the Justice Department. Trump issued his \"demand\" during a rally here as he repeatedly railed against Clinton's tenure at the State Department and her subsequent misleading and even false statements about whether she had sent or received classified information through her personal email account.  The White House has in no way suggested a pardon is under consideration. \"Here's the demand I'm making today to President Obama,\" Trump said. \"Will you pledge not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and against society itself? Will you make that pledge?\" Trump also challenged Clinton to pledge not to allow any of her aides who received immunity from the FBI to serve in a future Clinton administration. The FBI granted limited immunity deals to at least two Clinton aides, including Clinton's State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, when the FBI requested to search the two attorneys' laptops, sources told CNN late last week. This isn't the first time Trump has called for legal action to be taken against his Democratic challenger. In June, he called for Clinton to be jailed over the email matter, and he has said that if he is elected, he would instruct his attorney general to investigate her. Trump followed up his comments by raising several Clinton controversies from the 1990s, including the Whitewater scandal, the cattle futures controversy and even former President Bill Clinton's controversial 11th hour pardon of Marc Rich, a prominent oil trader who fled the country after learning of plans to indict him on tax evasion, racketeering and breaking an embargo against Iran. The former president said in a 2002 interview with Newsweek that he regretted making the pardon because \"it wasn't worth the damage to my reputation.\" Trump has infrequently raised Clinton scandals dating back to the 1990s on the campaign trail, and while he resisted the urge to raise Bill Clinton's marital infidelities at Monday's -- though he alluded to them -- Trump has suggested that he may at the next event. On Thursday, Trump raised Bill Clinton's impeachment during a rally, and has sought to connect the former president's missteps to Hillary Clinton. \"The people of this country are tired of the lies. They're tired of trivial politics. They're tired of being talked down to. They're tired of being looked down upon and being treated like second class citizens,\" Trump said Friday. He also picked back up on his warnings about voter fraud -- instances of which are extremely rare -- as he urged voters to keep an eye out on Election Day to \"make sure it's on the up and up.\" Trump has previously called on voters to monitor polling places on Election Day and watch for fraudulent behavior. \"Because you know what, that's a big, big problem in this country and nobody wants to talk about it,\" Trump said. \"So go and watch these polling places. Make sure it's on the up and up, please.\" \"That would be one hell of a way to lose,\" he added.  \n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton's ongoing struggle to deal with the revelation that she used a private email server during her time as secretary of state dominated the conversation about her presidential candidacy, and research suggests it might have doomed her campaign, according to a new study by a consortium of pollsters released over the weekend. In the paper, presented at the American Association for Public Opinion Research's annual conference in New Orleans, pollsters and political scientists from Gallup, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan studied the daily Gallup tracking poll from July 10 to November 7, 2016. In particular, they zeroed in on one question: \"Have you read, seen or heard anything about (Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump) in the last day or two?\" They then zeroed in on the \"yes\" responses and categorized what, exactly, people said they had read, seen or heard. Here's what people had read, seen or heard about Clinton looks like in a word cloud (the bigger the word, the more often it was mentioned): As you can see, \"email\" drowns out every other term mentioned about Clinton. It was, without question, the dominant narrative of the election for her -- at least in the five months that this paper documents. And, according to the study, the mentions of email correlate directly to negative views of Clinton. Now, check out Trump's word cloud: There's nothing to match the Clinton \"email\" mentions. And although some of the most commonly mentioned words are negative storylines for Trump -- \"women,\" most notably -- there's a lot of more neutral mentions: \"debate,\" \"people\" and \"president.\" This speaks to the theory that by throwing so many balls up in the air every day -- via his stump speeches, Twitter, etc. -- Trump made it impossible for anyone to follow all of them. Everything seemed like a molehill. Even the mountains.  What's more, the word \"email\" came up more and more in the final weeks of the election -- particularly in the wake of then-FBI Director James Comey's announcement in late October that he was re-starting an investigation into Clinton's server. RELATED: Hillary Clinton blames James Comey for her loss. Why not blame Anthony Weiner? Here's the word clouds broken into a week-by-week timeline of the last month of the campaign. Again, the larger the word appears, the more it was mentioned as something people had seen, read or heard about Clinton or Trump.  Not only did \"email\" dominate the conversation around Clinton, it dominated the entire conversation in the race. From October 23 on, Trump is barely talked about -- an amazing feat for someone so willing to make news. RELATED: Clinton: 'If the election had been on October 27, I would be your president' This study will be used by liberals as evidence that the media's unnecessary focus on Clinton's email server cost her the election.   I'd agree that Clinton's email server played a decisive role in deciding the election. But I wouldn't agree with the idea that the media is responsible for it.  After all, it was Clinton who never seemed to grasp the seriousness of the issue and how it eroded the public's already shaky confidence in her. Her inability to do those things meant she was never able to put the story behind her. And then the Comey announcement came, which undoubtedly surged the issue back to the top of many voters' minds. Whatever the reasons, when people thought of Clinton in the final weeks of the race, they thought of her emails. And that was a very bad thing for her.\n",
      "                             The Democratic National Convention was sent into upheaval over the weekend when Wikileaks released nearly 20,000 internal emails from the party -- some of which showed officials working against Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary.  US officials suspect the email dump is the work of Russian hackers who were discovered in DNC servers earlier this year, and experts believe the coordinated release of the documents on the eve of the convention are an effort by Moscow to meddle in the US presidential election.  Here's what you need to know about the leak. How do we know this is the work of Russia? Cybersecurity experts who initially responded to the DNC hack identified two distinct groups of hackers operating in the system -- one who had exclusively gone after the party's opposition research file on Donald Trump, and one that had been snooping on DNC emails for about a year.  Both were recognized as known Russian military or intelligence-affiliated hacking operations. Crowdstrike, the firm that responded to the hack, tracks dozens of advanced cyberespionage operations, many affiliated with governments. Each group has distinct ways of attacking their targets, down to the malicious software signatures they use. Several cybersecurity firms have verified Crowdstrike's findings that the perpetrators of the DNC attack were the two known Russian groups, and there is no evidence independent hackers could be separately responsible for the leaks.   While the government and FBI haven't officially pointed the finger at Russia, US officials briefed on the probe say the evidence so far points to groups known for conducting cyberintrusions for Moscow. Experts say the DNC emails bear evidence of passing through Russian hands and look to be efforts by the Russians to first, cover their tracks and cast doubt on their role in the hack, and second, influence the US election towards Donald Trump, who has spoken favorable of Russian President Vladimir Putin and advocated weakening NATO. The FBI put out a statement saying it was investigating.  \"A compromise of this nature is something we take very seriously, and the FBI will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,\" the FBI said.  Why did Debbie Wasserman Schultz resign? DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on Sunday, effective at the end of the convention, in the wake of the scandal, but her departure was a long time coming.  Wasserman Schultz has served atop the DNC since 2011, keeping the Florida seat in Congress she's held since 2005 as well. She faced criticism through her tenure for both her work was the spokeswoman for the party and her ability to fundraise.   She faced more blowback during the 2016 primary cycle, especially from supporters of Sanders who saw decisions like her insistence on a small number of debates at low viewership times as an effort to stack the deck in favor of Hillary Clinton.  Wasserman Schultz was already expected to have a reduced speaking role at the DNC in the wake of the criticism and distrust from supporters of the Vermont senator, and the email leaks forced her hand to announce her resignation.  The Florida congresswoman was booed and jeered during an appearance before the Florida delegation Monday morning. Who is in charge now? As Wasserman Schultz becomes the outgoing chair, DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile is serving as the interim chair through the election. CNN and Brazile mutually agreed to suspend her contract as a political commentator for the network after the announcement was made on Sunday.    Other names for replacing Wasserman Schultz are also being floated. According to a Democratic operative, Housing Secretary Julian Castro was being discussed by Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her inner circle.  In terms of convention operations, the DNC Rules Committee tapped Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge to fill in as permanent chair of the convention to gavel in and out each session, according to a DNC source.  What was in the emails? Emails were apparently leaked from seven DNC officials' accounts, though CNN was not able to independently verify their authenticity. Nearly 20,000 total emails were dumped, including some that exposed distaste for Sanders within the DNC. One email in May targeted Sanders' religious beliefs, with DNC chief financial officer Brad Marshall asking colleagues to \"get someone to ask his belief\" in God, without mentioning Sanders by name. The suggestion was that Sanders' faith could be a difference maker in Kentucky and West Virginia.   \"This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist,\" Marshall wrote. In another May email, Wasserman Schultz called Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver a \"damn liar\" for statements he made criticizing the Nevada Democratic Party after protests by Sanders supporters of what they said was subversion of party rules by Clinton backers. \n",
      "                             Before he endorsed Hillary Clinton's campaign, all was not well with Al Gore, her aides said in newly released emails hacked from her campaign chairman. Gore was a sore subject in conversations revealed Friday in hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. In an exchange released Friday, Clinton's top aides in November 2015 discussed Gore's public declaration he would not endorse Clinton's campaign, despite serving as her husband's vice president.  Gore, Clinton campaign together Top Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills sent a copy of an article on Gore's non-endorsement, to which aide Huma Abedin replied that they had been warned. Asked why the lack of endorsement after the Clintons endorsed his unsuccessful 2000 campaign by Mills, Abedin said there was a history. \"Well that was 16 years ago,\" she wrote. \"Hard to put on email but there is no love lost in this relationship. Reminder that he also refused to endorse in 2008!!!\" \"I know that's why i thought this time would be different,\" Mills replied. \"No its (sic) bad,\" Abedin wrote back. Gore did endorse Clinton after the primary was wrapped up, and this month campaigned with her for the first time since 2000. WikiLeaks has released emails daily over the past two weeks and has promised to do so into the future. US officials have said the releases bear the hallmarks of Russian meddling in the US election -- which WikiLeaks has denied. It is impossible to verify the authenticity of the emails or the context, as WikiLeaks controls their release and the Clinton campaign has refused to confirm or deny any documents' authenticity. The acrimony between Clinton and Gore has been well known since the White House years under Bill Clinton's administration, and before this month had last seen each other in 2014. Since his failed campaign for president, Gore has been involved less in politics and has focused on his signature issue of global climate change. That was the focus of their joint campaign appearance in Miami, in the state that famously cost Gore the election.\n",
      "                             Hillary Clinton met with the FBI for three and a half hours Saturday as part of the investigation into her use of a private email server while leading the State Department, her campaign said. \"Secretary Clinton gave a voluntary interview this morning about her email arrangements while she was secretary,\" Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement. \"She is pleased to have had the opportunity to assist the Department of Justice in bringing this review to a conclusion.\"  Clinton told MSNBC's Chuck Todd Saturday evening that the interview was something \"I had been eager to do.\" An aide said the interview occurred at FBI headquarters in Washington Saturday morning. The FBI declined to comment. The meeting signals the investigation is coming to an end, and sources tell CNN the expectation is Clinton will not face charges.  Still, the probe has cast a shadow over Clinton's campaign, and news of FBI agents interviewing the former secretary of state gave Republicans an opportunity to pounce after Clinton has spent weeks at the top of most polls. It has also put the Justice Department in the position of having a major impact on the 2016 race -- a role made even more awkward this week by an unplanned meeting between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch that raised questions about the impartiality of the probe. The question now becomes how long it will take for the FBI to conclude its probe. Within the next two weeks or so, the expectation is there will be an announcement of no charges being brought against Clinton so long as no evidence of wrongdoing emerges from her interview with the FBI, sources familiar with the investigation told CNN. CNN has previously reported no charges were expected to be brought against Clinton because the investigators had not found evidence to warrant charges, according to multiple law enforcement officials. A Democrat close to Clinton said Saturday the campaign believes the FBI will announce its decision before the conventions. Sources familiar with the investigation had previously told CNN the Justice Department's aim was to wrap up before the Republican and Democratic conventions later this month. The timing is crucial, because if Clinton were to be indicted before the convention, Democrats could perhaps nominate another candidate. Asked about reports that she is unlikely to face charges, Clinton told Todd, \"I am not going to comment on the process. I have no knowledge of any timelines. This is entirely up to the department.\" Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said it was \"impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton.\" \"It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!\" Trump tweeted, referring to the former president's meeting with Lynch. After reports surfaced that Clinton was unlikely to be charged, Trump then tweeted, \"It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!\"  Asked by CNN's Brianna Keilar in a \"State of the Union\" interview Saturday about the possibility of the presumptive Democratic nominee being indicted, New Jersey senator -- and potential Clinton running mate -- Cory Booker flatly ruled out the possibility. \"That's just not going to happen,\" said Booker, who declined to answer whether the former secretary of state should step aside in favor of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or Vice President Joe Biden if she's indicted before the election. \"That's something that, to me, is not even within the realm of possibility,\" Booker said.  A reminder of Clinton's trustworthiness issues The interview comes at the end of a week that could have been another win for Clinton as Trump continues to struggle, but instead demonstrated her -- and her husband's -- inability to avoid unforced errors and leave past controversies behind. House Benghazi Committee Republicans on Tuesday released their report on the September 11, 2012, attack where four Americans died, which drew significant media attention but lacked significant new information that changed the dynamic of the race. The panel's biggest discovery was finding the email address and server over a year ago. Clinton has maintained that no emails marked as classified at the time were sent on the server, and that information in some emails was retroactively classified. And her campaign has actively portrayed the congressional investigation into Benghazi as a partisan exercise, highlighted by last October's 11-hour hearing where Clinton testified. But the FBI interview, along with news of the Clinton-Lynch meeting, shows Clinton can't move past the email issue -- a story that overshadowed the launch of her campaign in early 2015 and helped Bernie Sanders find running room. Sanders, in fact, is still in the race, pushing for progressive changes to the Democratic platform. As recently as Thursday, the Vermont senator said he's not ready to endorse Clinton. For Republicans, the possibility of an indictment is a satisfying one. The GOP has pursued the Clintons for 25 years, from the scandals of Bill Clinton's presidency and his impeachment to Hillary Clinton's actions leading up to and during the Benghazi attacks. That the FBI could hamstring her presidential ambitions is a bonus for the GOP.  Republicans pounce Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that Clinton is now \"the first major party presidential candidate to be interviewed by the FBI as part of a criminal investigation surrounding her reckless conduct.\" \"That the FBI wanted her for questioning reinforces her central role in deliberately creating a culture which put her own political ambitions above State Department rules and jeopardized our national security. In over 2,000 emails, Clinton's decision exposed classified information, including 22 that included top secret intelligence, just so she could skirt transparency laws in order to hide her shady dealings as secretary of state,\" Priebus continued.  He added, \"The American people need to have confidence that the Obama Justice Department is conducting a fair and impartial investigation, but when the attorney general meets secretly with Bill Clinton just days before Hillary's interrogation is conducted discreetly over a holiday weekend, it raises serious concerns about special treatment.\" RNC chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer also pounced on the news Saturday afternoon. \".@HillaryClinton campaign statement says She \"voluntarily\" met w @FBI for 3.5 hours this morning - yeah, lots of people volunteer 2 do that,\" he tweeted.  He quickly added, \"Now I get it! After Attorney General @LorettaLynch &amp; @billclinton secretly meet @HillaryClinton spends 3.5 hrs  #FourthOfJulyWeekend @fbi HQ\"  But the interview is a reminder for Republicans that Trump is a major liability himself. He's more unpopular than Clinton is and his poll numbers are sliding. Her campaign and allies have been airing millions of dollars' worth of ads against him, many highlighting his impolitic statements about women and minorities -- two groups that are backing Clinton by large margins.  The GOP establishment has yet to fully rally around the billionaire New York businessman, who trails Clinton 46% to 40% in the latest CNN Poll of Polls and has struggled to raise money in comparison to the Clinton and Democratic juggernaut. The revelations of the email server as part of the House's Benghazi probe have also resulted in lawsuits filed in Freedom of Information Act cases by the conservative Judicial Watch and other groups. One such lawsuit saw Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, deposed this week, along with other State Department staffers. A State Department Inspector General report released in late May said Clinton failed to follow rules or inform key staff about the server. \"At a minimum, Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and, because she did not do so, she did not comply with the Department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act,\" the report said.\n",
      "                             Last year's now-infamous airport tarmac meeting between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton was a crucial moment for FBI Director James Comey, he said Wednesday, marking the moment he decided that the Department of Justice was not capable of an independent investigation into Hillary Clinton. \"A number of things had gone on which I can't talk about yet, that made me worry that the department leadership could not credibly complete the investigation and decline prosecution without grievous damage to the American people's confidence in the justice system,\" Comey said, testifying before the Senate judiciary committee. \"And then the capper was -- and I'm not picking on the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, who I like very much -- but her meeting with President Clinton on that airplane was the capper for me, and I then said, you know what, the department cannot, by itself, credibly end this,\" he added.  Comey indicated that he was already moving towards a decision to announce the investigation's conclusion on his own because he believed top DOJ officials couldn't do it and be viewed as impartial.  For Comey, Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton was the last straw.  Lynch and Bill Clinton met privately in Phoenix in June 2016 after the two realized they were on the same tarmac, an aide to the former president told CNN at the time. The criticism of the meeting prompted Lynch to say that she would accept the determinations and findings of the FBI and career prosecutors who were investigating the Democratic presidential candidate over her use of a private email server while secretary of state.  RELATED: James Comey explains why he alerted Congress right before the election on Clinton's emails A spokesman for President Bill Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Comey has faced fierce criticism -- including during Wednesday's hearing -- for his alerting Congress just before the election of the FBI search of Anthony Weiner's computer because it might have relevant information to the Clinton investigation. The emails found on the computer did not change the determination of the FBI's probe, and Clinton went on to lose the election to Donald Trump. \n",
      "                             Gov. Chris Christie weighed in Monday on the email controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton and said policies in his own office have changed in the past year regarding state email accounts.  \"There's always going to be a story out there about folks ? Secretary Clinton or others,\" the New Jersey Republican said when asked about the Clinton emails. \"My answer is that people should follow the law.\" Clinton maintains that she didn't break any rules while she used her private email account and a personal server to conduct all of her business at the State Department. However, the issue has exploded amongst Republicans and the media as a potential liability for Clinton, who's considered the presumptive Democratic nominee once she launches her likely presidential bid.  READ: For Clinton, sharp tweets foreshadow imminent campaign Christie, who made his comments in his monthly \"Ask the Governor\" radio appearance on NJ101.5, said there's no law in New Jersey that requires state business be conducted on state email accounts.  After the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal burst onto the national scene in early 2014, however, Christie said his office started requiring personnel \"to maintain a state email account, and that you conduct business on that state email account.\"  The controversy in his administration was partly discovered from texts and other communications between one of Christie's aides and a top political ally. The exchanges appeared to link them to the closure of access lanes to the nation's busiest bridge to punish a Democratic mayor. It led to investigations by his own administration, the state legislature, and the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, the latter of whom is still conducting a probe. Christie has not been found guilty of any involvement or wrongdoing.  Also during the radio program, Christie said he's getting close to making a 2016 presidential decision and will announce in the \"late spring, early summer\" time frame, saying there are \"still things I'm working through and talking to my family about.\" SEE: Why Ted Cruz is running now Asked if he thinks he can beat Clinton, who's expected to launch her campaign in early April, Christie said confidence in winning should be a prerequisite to kicking off a campaign.  \"There's no reason to run unless you think you can (win),\" he said. \"If I ran, I wouldn't be in it for the experience.\" The radio appearance came hours after Sen. Ted Cruz threw his hat into the ring and announced his campaign at Liberty University in Virginia. Christie said the Texas senator's decision won't affect his own decision making process, nor his fundraising prospects.  \"That's kind of talking-head stuff from cable networks,\" he said.   \n",
      "                             House Oversight Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz is asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions to look into the staffer who helped set up former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server. In a letter sent Thursday evening, Chaffetz recommends former Clinton IT aide Bryan Pagliano for prosecution over failure to show up in person to his committee in compliance with a subpoena. Pagliano became a key player during the investigation into Clinton's email practices as secretary of state. \"If left unaddressed, Pagliano's conduct in ignoring a lawful congressional subpoena could gravely impair Congress's ability  to exercise its core constitutional authorities of oversight and legislation,\" Chaffetz wrote. The law Chaffetz accused Pagliano of violating is a misdemeanor offense punishable by a fine between $100 and $1,000 as well as between a month and a year in jail. CNN has reached out to Pagliano for comment. The Utah Republican said the committee requested Pagliano's testimony at a September 2016 hearing and that Pagliano's lawyer told the committee he would \"not appear voluntarily\" and if he did appear, he would plead the Fifth -- the right to not answer questions to avoid potentially incriminating oneself. The letter to Sessions said Chaffetz issued a subpoena served electronically to Pagliano. The original hearing was recessed and a back and forth ensued between Chaffetz and Pagliano's attorneys, according to the letter.  Pagliano never showed, and the committee voted on party lines to hold him in contempt. At the time, Pagliano's lawyers said Chaffetz's demand \"betrays a naked political agenda,\" saying the subpoena served no valid legislative purpose. Chaffetz, however, argued otherwise at the time and in his letter on Thursday. \"There is no legal basis for Pagliano's refusal to appear before the committee,\" the letter read. At a deposition with the conservative group Judicial Watch earlier in 2016, a spokeswoman from the group said Pagliano invoked the Fifth about 125 times. He also invoked his Fifth Amendment rights in a closed door session with the House Select Committee on Benghazi in 2015. As part of the Justice Department investigation into Clinton's email practices, Pagliano accepted an immunity deal. The FBI never pursued criminal charges against Clinton or others over the arrangement. But the FBI closing its investigation and the end of the election hasn't stopped Chaffetz's dogged pursuit of the Clinton email saga. On Inauguration Day, he shook her hand and later wrote, \"The investigation continues.\"\n",
