                            Donald Trump on Thursday called for his likely Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to be imprisoned. "I will say this, Hillary Clinton has got to go to jail," Trump told supporters here as he slammed Clinton's foreign policy speech earlier in the day in which Clinton called Trump dangerous and "temperamentally unfit" to be president. "Folks, honestly, she's guilty as hell," Trump said of the Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Trump has previously accused Clinton of breaking federal law, but his comments on Thursday are his most direct call yet for Clinton to face jail time over her use of private email to conduct official State Department affairs. The FBI is investigating Clinton's use of a private emails to determine whether anyone improperly handled classified information. At a news conference earlier this week, Trump declined to say whether he believes Clinton's private email use amounted to a felony. Trump also suggested Thursday that if Clinton is not indicted over her email use, he would direct his attorney general to investigate her. "Five years' statute of limitations, if I win. Everything is going to be fair but I'm sure the attorney general will take a very good look at it," Trump said. Trump peppered his speech Thursday with digs at Clinton but largely avoided responding directly to many of the claims Clinton leveled against him earlier in the day, in which she accused the presumptive Republican nominee of having "dangerously incoherent" ideas on foreign policy. Instead, Trump hit Clinton over her email use and critiqued Clinton's speaking style, suggesting that "it's hard to stay awake" when listening to Clinton speak.
