                            Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said Tuesday it "seems like" the FBI has not fully investigated the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department under Hillary Clinton's leadership. "The evidence indicates to me that this should be fully investigated. I cannot say that Mr. Comey has not completed a full investigation but it seems like he has not," he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day." "And I think there is a cloud over this and just because he might conclude there is not a chargeable offense does not indicate that there is no wrongdoing."  "This is not healthy. You do not use the Secretary of State position to benefit your private foundation," the Trump supporter added.  A federal judge Monday gave the State Department until September 23 to develop a plan on how to release nearly 15,000 emails and documents the FBI had obtained as part of its investigation into Clinton's private email server. The decision could possibly create a timeline where thousands of emails and documents could be made public shortly before Election Day on November 8. Sessions wants an investigation because he suggested Clinton used her position to possibly "extort" money from international governments for her family's foundation. "The fundamental thing is you cannot be Secretary of State of the United States of America and use that position to extort or seek contributions to your private foundation," the Republican senator said. "That is a fundamental violation of law and that does appear to have happened." Session's comments come the day after Trump called for a special prosecutor to be named to investigate the Clinton Foundation.  CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment. FBI Director James Comey recommended against criminal charges last month for Clinton over her use of a private email server, though he did characterize her behavior as "extremely careless" with classified material.
