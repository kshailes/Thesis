                            One of Hillary Clinton's top campaign aides raised concerns about FBI Director James Comey almost a year to the day before he dropped a huge surprise on them which shifted the momentum of the presidential race. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote in an email released Friday by WikiLeaks that Comey's comments about the spate of police shootings and Black Lives Matter confirmed her concerns about him.  "I get a big, fat 'I told you so' on Comey being a bad choice," Palmieri wrote in an Oct. 27, 2015 email to campaign chairman John Podesta.  The email was included in the most recent batch of emails hacked from Podesta's personal account. Its release comes one week after Comey rocked the presidential race with news that the FBI had discovered new Clinton emails.  Palmieri, in the 2015 "I told you so" email, linked to a New York Times story in which the White House broke with Comey over his comments that the increased scrutiny of police had led to a recent increase in violent crime.
