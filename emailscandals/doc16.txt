                            Ted Cruz takes a swing in a new ad at Hillary Clinton's email server controversy with a spoof of a famous scene from the cult classic comedy "Office Space." In the 1999 movie, a group of software company workers drag a chronically malfunctioning printer into an open field to stomp on and pulverize it with a baseball bat. Cruz's spot adjusts the frame a bit, substituting in a Clinton character, along with a couple of her aides, and exchanging the printer for a computer drive. The musical backing will be familiar to the movie's fans -- a neat parody of the Geto Boys' 1992 single "Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta." Cruz's version begins, "Damn it feels good to be a Clinton. A shameless politician always plays her cards right." It goes on to call out the press for keeping "their their mouths tight" in defense of the "entitled" former secretary of state and former president.  "A Clinton plays the victim for promotion, a Clinton kills it off with a smile," the lyrics continue. "Damn it feels good to be a Clinton, a server full of secrets ain't no thing. Damn it feels good to be a Clinton, nothing ever hits with a sting." And with that, the actress playing Hillary Clinton drives one final heel into the battered computer tower. The ad will air during "Saturday Night Live" in South Carolina statewide, a spokesperson for the Cruz campaign said.  The new Cruz spot comes after another one of his ads was pulled down on Thursday after it was revealed that one of the actors had performed in erotic films. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
