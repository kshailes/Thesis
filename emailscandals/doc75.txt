                            House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday night House Republicans would ask FBI Director James Comey to testify on Capitol Hill about his recommendation to not prosecute Hillary Clinton for her private email server use. Ryan told Fox News' Megyn Kelly that the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, chaired by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, would call upon Comey to divulge more information on how he could square his scalding of Clinton's decisions with his suggestion that she is not legally culpable. "We're going to have hearings," Ryan said, noting Comey did not take questions from the press. "There are a lot of unanswered questions here." Ryan also recommended that the Director of National Intelligence "should block her access to classified information" as a form of punishment. "There are a lot of unanswered questions here," Ryan said, though he did would not say that Comey folded to political pressure when asked.  "He shredded the case that she had been making all year long," Ryan said. Earlier on Tuesday, House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte told CNN's Manu Raju that they were "looking at" holding hearings on the FBI investigation, "but we haven't made any decisions yet." He had just left a meeting with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.
