                            FBI Director James Comey said Tuesday he does not see a need for urgency in completing the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. But he did say that he is staying "close to this one to make sure we have the resources to do it competently," the Niagara-Gazette reported Tuesday. Comey, in a visit to the FBI's Buffalo, New York, field office, said it's the agency's priority to complete the investigation "well and promptly" but that "well" comes first. Sources have previously told CNN that the investigation has entered its final stages.  When asked by reporters whether he felt any pressure to wrap up the investigation prior to the Democratic convention in July, Comey said no, CNN affiliate WIVB.com reported. "The only reason I hesitate is in any investigation of intense public interest, whether it involved a public figure. Involves some horrific crime. San Bernardino is a great example. We feel a great sense of urgency to do it well and to do it promptly," Comey said. While the Clinton email server investigation has garnered substantially more attention that any other ongoing FBI investigation, Comey brushed away concerns over the political implications that could come from the investigations findings. "I wouldn't say the concerns are any different in any of the high profile cases. And the reason is good people want to know. There's an intense interest in investigations like that," Comey said.
