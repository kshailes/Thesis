                            A group of Democratic senators are questioning whether investigations by two inspectors general offices into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server are impartial.  In a letter addressed to the Inspector General of National Intelligence Charles McCullough III and Inspector General of the Department of State Steve Linick, ranking members of the Senate Intelligence, Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs, and Judiciary committees expressed concerns that those involved in the review of the former secretary of state's emails are not considering the "complexities or the interagency difference on each email into account," the letter read.  The senators asked the IGs "perform your duties dispassionately and comprehensively" and then requested that they respond to the lawmakers' questions by March 31. While pointing out that email reviews of the last five secretaries of state have taken place under the inspector general's office, the senators call the process of classifying emails "complex" and "subjective" and adding that its not "normally within the purview of inspectors general," the letter said.  The concerns, according to the letter, are raised after a "potential whistleblower" from the State Department's inspector general office "accused the office of having an anti-Clinton bias," as well as alleged inaccuracies in the classification of emails thought to have included classified information, which was later proved to be inaccurate.  The letter concluded by acknowledging how "politicized" the review has been and then sets forth a number of questions for the inspectors general to answer regarding information leaks to the media and their review process.
