And what the Clintons do is, never clear the air," the syndicated columnist said.  "They spend the first month or so - surrogates, the machine - attacking the accusers, as in the Lewinsky scandal."Krauthammer said that, unlike New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who held a multiple-hour press conference in the wake of allegations he had improperly closed a bridge as a political retaliation, Clinton would only do more damage by opening herself up to more scrutiny."She can't do it because, the answers to the questions - if remotely honest - are self-indicting," Krauthammer said.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC.
