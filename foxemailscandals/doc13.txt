Clinton has said consistently that she turned over all her government emails.Goldberg said there is no truth left to any of Clinton’s original claims.“If you go back and you go to her initial press conference at the UN, she had this granite façade of a cover story and that facts that have come out since then have not only pounded it to rubble, it’s grounded it to a fine paste,” he said."There’s literally not a single factual assertion she’s made since back then that hasn’t been proved to be a demonstrable lie," Goldberg added. "And the amazing thing, I mean – at some point you’d think she’d just want to fire her lawyers because they were the ones who said they had gone through everything with a fine tooth comb. They read every individual email. Turns out that wasn’t true either."This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.
