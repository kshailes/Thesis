This is a rush transcript from "The Five," July 6, 2016. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.DANA PERINO, CO-HOST: Hello, everyone, I'm Dana Perino along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Eric Bolling and Greg Gutfeld. It is 5 o'clock in New York City and this is "The Five."The FBI may have cleared Hillary Clinton of any criminal wrongdoing, but this e-mail scandal is not going away any time soon. Now some members of Congress want answers. Tomorrow, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will question Director James Comey. On Tuesday, his boss, Attorney General Loretta Lynch will face the judiciary committee. Speaker Paul Ryan wants the FBI to handover all findings from the investigation and says Clinton should be blocked from having further access to classified materials.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), HOUSE SPEAKER: He did say that short of prosecution, some kind of administration -- administrative action might be in order. Look, I was on the ticket in 2012. After the convention, you get the full deep classified information as part of transition. It's part of being a nominee. I think the DNI, Clapper, should deny Hillary Clinton access to classified information during this campaign, given how she so recklessly handled classified information.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: Ryan also said that this case sums up the political machine that the Clinton has created.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)RYAN: This certainly does underscore the belief that the Clintons live above the law. And this is one of the reasons why people are so dissatisfied, so upset about government. They think that people live by different sets of rules, and the Clintons, they take the candle on this one.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right, I'm going to go quickly -- quick to this RNC ad that they put together with Comey's statements versus Hillary Clinton's statements. A short clip of that and then get everybody's reaction.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal e-mails instead of two.JAMES COMEY, DIRECTOR, FBI: She also used numerous mobile devices to send and to read e-mail on that personal domain.CLINTON: I did not e-mail any classified materials to anyone on my e-mail.COMEY: One hundred and ten e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information.CLINTON: There were no security breaches.COMEY: We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact .(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: OK, so often when you get a baffling decision like the one that FBI Director Comey put forward yesterday afternoon. After a night sleep, you wake with all that more clarity. But Kimberly, I saw you this morning after reading all the press, I felt like it was still as confusing as before and so why it happens?KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yeah, and still kind of a shocking in many ways because of the 14 minutes spent diligently going through all the detail, all the specifics, really making the case, well, it's like he's really giving us a tremendous amount of information of this, an opening statement? Closing argument for the case against Hillary Clinton? Oh, but no. Because at the end, like it was some kind of weird copy/paste situation, but the wrong conclusion was put in.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: And it just -- it was like, whoa, what happened here? And when you see him, I almost felt sorry for him in these videos, because he really looks like almost like a hostage to the situation. Like he's not -- like he's had a hard time of it, he didn't look great. So I imagine that this wasn't something that he was personally proud of. He didn't take questions afterwards, but he's going to have to face questions going forward and let's see if he answers them in the interest of transparency.PERINO: Greg, do you think that FBI Director Comey was trying to strike a balance in his head, that he thought that the verbal punishment that he was delivering in the statement before the conclusion would be enough to exonerate him from any blame that it was political?GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: I think so. I think the republicans, especially tomorrow should embrace Comey. He didn't just leave an impression on Hillary; he left a crater the size of little rock. I mean he, he handed to the republicans the road map to victory. He laid out every single flaw. And if you attack Comey on this, it's a mistake. You got to stick to Hillary. By the way, it would be hilarious to have a presidential candidate without a security clearance. That's like -- it's like Danica Patrick without her driver's license. He would essentially make it so that they can't do their job, by really -- I think that, you know, he did something -- he did something he didn't have to do. I think at this point, if you -- you could run a sack of potatoes with a wig against Hillary and beat her at this point, which is kind of what we're doing.PERINO: I think all -- in some of the coverage, Eric --(CROSSTALK)ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: Why Hillary?PERINO: Well, I was going to ask you about --(CROSSTALK)(LAUGHTER)BOLLING: That was proof right there. I'm sorry.PERINO: No, I was just going to ask you about President Obama's complicit in this scandal, I think, because they all knew that she was using .(CROSSTALK)PERINO: . this e-mail address and they didn't do anything about it.BOLLING: Well, yeah. Perhaps, yes, but also they had to know this recommendation was coming down this way. There is no way on Sunday or Monday President Obama says, "I will meet with you. I'll fly you on Air Force One to North Carolina, we'll land and I'll be standing next to you on a stage for our very first campaign event." If he doesn't know the recommendation earlier -- hours earlier was gonna be --(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Yes --PERINO: Well, but they announced the trip a week -- the week before.BOLLING: Yeah, but still -- OK, let me ask you this. If they, if they --GUILFOYLE: That morning there, the campaign will confirm .BOLLING: Right.GUILFOYLE: . yes or no, we're getting pushed back that he is not promising to (inaudible).BOLLING: How is it? It's the weather. We can't get on Air Force One because of the weather. There could have been anything if there was going to be a recommendation to indict. James Comey spent 15 minutes on -- with this presentation. He did three or four minutes on -- remember three things; what we did, what we found, what we recommend? Three or four minutes on what we did, about 10 minutes on what we found, the vast majority of his time speaking is what we found and that is bad for Hillary Clinton. And that plays right into what Greg is saying. The vast majority of what he said was campaign fodder for Donald Trump. And then the one to two minutes of, by the way, we found all that. We're not recommending any sort of action, which I think is -- ridiculous.PERINO: And then a strange thing, Juan, is that is really not his role, so --GUILFOYLE: No.PERINO: He is the FBI. They provide -- they sent all the -- they finish the investigation and they -- correct me if I'm wrong, Kimberly, then they give it to the prosecutors and they make a decision, but --GUILFOYLE: Yes, correct.PERINO: So basically, Comey took a bullet for the political appointees, so that they didn't have to be the ones to suffer any fallout from it. So, is he the hero the left?JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: I don't know that he's the hero, I mean James Comey is a republican, but I think that what he did in his mind, I like the way that you pose the question to Greg. I think he felt he was taking responsibility and, you know, picking up on what Greg said, I think that when he -- what he did was he thought, look, I'm giving you the entire record which indicates that Hillary Clinton behaved recklessly with classified or secure information, but I don't think that there is any evidence that she was disloyal to the United States, intended, intended to send classified information or somehow intentionally mishandled classified information. Therefore --GUILFOYLE: Which --WILLIAMS: In terms of the standard for prosecution, he said, "It's never been done before without these elements and I don't see it's going to be done."GUILFOYLE: But that's just not true. There is like 12 to 13 instances where, in fact, it has been done. And in fact, it's irrelevant whether she intended to or not because quite simply, that is not the standard of proof that it requires.WILLIAMS: Well, I think that's what James Comey said, so that's all --GUILFOYLE: No. he would say --WILLIAMS: All I'm reporting.GUILFOYLE: I think it's because you don't derail a presidential nominee .WILLIAMS: That's a good point.GUILFOYLE: . the presumptive nominee .WILLIAMS: So I was --GUILFOYLE: . at the party, unless what? He has clear and convincing? But that's changing the game.WILLIAMS: Well, no.GUILFOYLE: That's changing the rules of evidence .PERINO: And not his rule.GUILFOYLE: . and the stand down of proof.WILLIAMS: Well, it's not my --GUILFOYLE: Yeah, and it's out of bounds.WILLIAMS: it might not be his goals, but there's --GUILFOYLE: But they should have given him a stand down order because it's the prosecutor call.WILLIAMS: "The Wall Street Journal" said something very fascinating this morning in the editorial page, they said, basically, maybe Comey did this because he wants to spare the country a Trump presidency, but that's not his role.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: But they also said that let's just been -- just be honest about it.WILLIAMS: Yeah, let's be blind (ph). That's what they said.(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: But I will say this that, what I think is, the mistake now is that they're going to put Comey in the box.GUTFELD: Right.WILLIAMS: Instead of going after Hillary now, it's going after Comey.GUTFELD: Exactly.WILLIAMS: And you're going to say, oh, Mr. Comey show me internals of these FBI investigations. My God, you're gonna raise the ghost to J. Edgar Hoover. All of a sudden, you politicizing FBI files.GUTFELD: Yes, he did. He -- it's frustrating, you have this gift. And the republicans may have, may shoot the gift giver.PERINO: They always over --GUTFELD: They overreach.PERINO: They overreach and then they look bad --GUTFELD: Focus on the facts.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: Don't start shooting around the room.GUILFOYLE: No grandstanding.BOLLING: Let's put back on that a little bit, and he also is the guy. Look, I know he's wonderful, above reproach in most instances, but he is the guy who decided after, how many? Thousands -- count, tens of thousands of hours, a hundred and fifty or so FBI investigators, Comey through tens of thousands of e-mails. They're working hard. They think they find 200 smoking guns or a thousand smoking guns where she has lied, saying, "I don't -- I never sent a classified e-mail," but she has on several thousand occasions. And then he says, "We're not going to recommend you go further," --WILLIAMS: He said --BOLLING: Wait a minute. I just spent the last seven, eight months of my life finding this and you go, we're not going to do anything with it?WILLIAMS: Right. He said -- well, he said a few, not thousand, and --BOLLING: No, no. He said 200 e-mails .WILLIAMS: No.BOLLING: . are classified .WILLIAMS: Well not thousands.BOLLING: . at the highest level.WILLIAMS: Remember, we're talking about .BOLLING: And 2,000 .WILLIAMS: . tens of thousands o pages.BOLLING: . were classified as the next higher.WILLIAMS: Ten of thousands of pages of e-mails.BOLLING: It is on thousands, Juan.WILLIAMS: So what he said is, "There was no intent to break the law."PERINO: But that is --(CROSSTALK)PERINO: I have to say that's a pretty -- it's kind of frustrating to me -- to hear that because I did have FBI Top Secret clearance for a long time. I was privileged to do and I took it very seriously. And you don't have to have intent. That's what -- I remember that briefing like it was yesterday, because you have to take it so seriously to sign on the dotted line like you understand that if you mishandle this will information .GUILFOYLE: Right.PERINO: . at a minimum, you'll be stripped of your security clearance. So I think the other gifts that Comey gave to the republicans if they already use it correctly is that, once again, you have the Clintons acting like they are above law, and in this case, they are --GUTFELD: Yeah, you know --PERINO: Above the law.GUTFELD: The Clintons are like a giant mud puddle at a bus stop. You don't want to stand near them. And it doesn't matter who you are .GUILFOYLE: You got splat.GUTFELD: . because Comey is a good person. And we said this, Lynch is a good person, but you can't look at them the same anymore because they got splattered by Clinton mud, and that doesn't come off easily.BOLLING: Do you think she signed .PERINO: True.BOLLING: . the same document that you did?PERINO: Hillary Clinton?BOLLING: Yeah.PERINO: I believe. And actually, I think that that was produced .GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: . and released by the State department.BOLLING: So she did sign that document. Isn't there a case to be made?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . that she violated that document?GUILFOYLE: Well, that's why I don't think this is over.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: And her security clearance should be --(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: Yeah, because there should be an administrative hearing to revoke the security clearances like Paul Ryan. And like Marco Rubio was calling for today, earlier, when I interviewed him, saying listen, these people, all of them that are part of her staff; Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. All of these people should be subjected to having their security clearances revoked.BOLLING: And if she sign --GUILFOYLE: And you heard Paul Ryan say --BOLLING: And if she sign --GUILFOYLE: Yeah, well --BOLLING: There -- why not.PERINO: I believe the State Department released that last year.BOLLING: Yeah.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: The other thing that bother me was in, when Comey talked about how she would use her mobile devices inappropriately in countries that are .GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: . hostile us to. And I was remembering when we went to Russia, and I think it was 2007, the secret service told us, "You gonna have to leave your BlackBerrys on Air Force One. And you should have seen all of us like -- how can we possible do our jobs if we leave our BlackBerrys here? And it was like giving up your security blanket -- literally, and -- but we did it, because that information doesn't belong to us. It belongs to the nation. So we all took out the batteries, gave it to the secret service, left the phones on the plane and we were able to survive just fine. But if we hadn't done that, we had defied the secret service and done that. We -- at a minimum stripped of our clearances.GUTFELD: And, of course, they tell you how to dress in certain countries. So you do --(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: So you are kept safe from the (inaudible), you know, who believe that you must dress like this, but then can you have your, your BlackBerry is completely vulnerable.WILLIAMS: So they're going to keep this going all summer, you guys think, right? Because they got recess coming up, he wants to have hearings so there are going to be hearings in judiciary, hearings and oversight. It just is going to go on. You know what?GUILFOYLE: But it's also the Clinton Foundation that you have a problem with.WILLIAMS: The danger is people are just going to be like, you know .PERINO: Yup.WILLIAMS: . republicans, they are doing another Benghazi.GUTFELD: No, I'd like --WILLIAMS: They just can't let go.GUTFELD: No, but you are -- you were right if they -- if they shoot all over the place. But if they focus on Hillary and just say, you know, she wasn't indicted in court but, boy, Comey indicted her in the court of public opinion.WILLIAMS: OK.GUTFELD: Her character, her trustworthiness. She -- if you just focus on one thing.GUILFOYLE: Right.GUTFELD: She's unfit to be president because she was as, as a secretary of state put the country at risk. That's all you need.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And she thinks she's better than you.GUTFELD: Yeah.BOLLING: And don't forget.(CROSSTALK)BOLLING: Benghazi created the e-mails .GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: . issue, with e-mails issue may create open the door for some Clinton Foundation.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: So yes, stay on it.GUILFOYLE: And maybe Loretta is not gonna file the charges.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: And --GUILFOYLE: November, a decision may be made. That's a fact.PERINO: And you know we're staying on it.GUILFOYLE: Yeah.PERINO: Into the next block, too.GUTFELD: No, no, no, no. We're not.(CROSSTALK)PERINO: We're now going to move on to the next topic.(LAUGHTER)PERINO: Because as can you imagine, Donald Trump has a lot to say about the outcome of the FBI investigation. Kimberly spoke with him a short while ago and you're going to hear that conversation, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUILFOYLE: The FBI cleared Hillary Clinton of criminal wrongdoing and Donald Trump is convinced it was the administration's plan all along.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESUMPTIVE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Today is the best evidence ever that we've seen that our system is absolutely totally rigged. Like a criminal with a guilty conscience, Clinton had her lawyers delete, destroy, and wipe away forever. Thirty thousand e-mails. This again, this qualifies her from service. She said today that we may consider the attorney general to go forward. That's like a bribe, isn't it? Isn't it sort of a bribe?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I think it's a bribe.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: While I interviewed the presumptive republican nominee, a few hours ago and he agrees with House Speaker Paul Ryan and others that Clinton should not be granted access to classified information after she becomes the nominee.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: I think that she certainly is not trustworthy. She lies to give her information that so vital to the country. How can you possibly do it? Her aides are under tremendous suspicion right now. I don't see how you can give her confidential and very important information. She's not a trustworthy person.GUILFOYLE: And --TRUMP: And by the way, you speak about temperament, she's got a horrendous temperament. She would be a terrible president. She would be an absolute -- this will be four more years of Obama, and probably worse.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: No, Greg.GUTFELD: That's the best -- you know the best part about that was.GUILFOYLE: What?GUTFELD: Just watching you.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Oh, OK. Thanks creepy guy across the table from me.GUTFELD: It was a compliment.GUILFOYLE: Oh, would -- oh, thank you.(CROSSTALK)GUILFOYLE: I think it's very sweet of you. Thank you so much. I was like --GUTFELD: No, he was so stoic (ph).(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: No, he was so stoic (ph).GUILFOYLE: Perfectly still. Perfectly still with great posture from us being Bluebirds and the --PERINO: That's right.GUTFELD: I was a Bluebird.GUILFOYLE: I'll count on that.GUILFOYLE: So Dana --(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: You are kind around with Bluebird.GUILFOYLE: Let's talk a little bit about this in terms of the optics for the Republican Party communicating, getting the message out. You saw the RNC trying to make the most of this. And then Trump, of course, using this opportunity to really hit Hillary hard because he's been calling her lyin', he's been calling her crooked to say that the system is rigged.PERINO: Yeah, I would use -- I think the most effective thing for Donald Trump to do is to use FBI Director Comey's words and quote those words over and over again. I think that he got on the right tracks today. I think last night, you know, going after Saddam Hussein and things like that, like that gets you off message and didn't have a great weekend that way, but today it sort of back on track. I don't love the teleprompter thing, but I think that he was getting closer to hitting on that mark. The other thing I would do is to say, to me, it's very clear. There is right versus wrong. And it's black and white when it comes to the nation's secrets, right? And I'll be for you. I would work for you on behalf of the people. It will not be about me. That would be an effective thing to say.GUILFOYLE: Bolling, what is the messaging here?BOLLING: I hear some message. Donald Trump, I go, you know, I started this campaign as an outsider. I'm an outsider. What you just saw the democrats do is total inside Washington, inside politics .GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: . corrupt, pay to play. Hand in your pocket. I'll promise you a judgeship or whatever. Supreme Court if you just look the other way if he, if he decides to indict. He didn't. It's unbelievable how corrupt it appears to the average American right now.GUILFOYLE: Right.BOLLING: Whether it's corrupt or not, most people who watch and go, you know what? It doesn't sound right. It doesn't look right. The timeline is incredible. Bill meets Loretta Lynch on the tarmac, eight, nine days ago. Three days ago, the FBI meets Hillary Clinton. One day ago, it's all acquitted -- the recommendation is not to, not to indict. It's just -- it (inaudible).GUILFOYLE: And next thing you know, Hillary Clinton is standing at the podium with the presidential seal, Juan, next to President Obama and he said that .PERINO: She has great timing.GUILFOYLE: . she had the most qualified person to ever run for president.WILLIAMS: Well, I have to say, I'm listening to Eric. And I think Eric, you're not giving your guy good advice. Because when he starts talking about -- this is a conspiracy? And that, oh, he's -- she's bribing Loretta Lynch and that Comey is for -- it's like some kind of a stoop, you know, for Hillary Clinton and everybody. And when he's talking about Saddam Hussein, it's kind of -- he's not a bad guy, because he went after the terrorists. And poor Bernie Sanders, where is Bernie Sanders? I think, man .BOLLING: My advice is --WILLIAMS: . you are way, way, way off .BOLLING: My advice was --WILLIAMS: . way off of Hillary Clinton.BOLLING: My advice was to stay on this and look on the outsider, that's inside politics .PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: Well, no.BOLLING: . that you see.WILLIAMS: You know why it doesn't work?BOLLING: I'm not part of that.WILLIAMS: Because then it opens the door for Hillary to come back and say, oh yeah, I let go 55,000 pages of e-mails. Where are your tax returns?GUILFOYLE: Oh, oh really?WILLIAMS: Oh, I don't see your tax returns --GUILFOYLE: What about all the e-mails that she deleted and that her lawyers went through .WILLIAMS: Well, that's more on to say --GUILFOYLE: . and deleted, and then they cleaned their devices. So Comey sat there and said, "Don't know what was there because we couldn't get access to it."WILLIAMS: What doesn't --GUILFOYLE: Because they made sure that it wasn't recoverable.WILLIAMS: Well, so you could --GUILFOYLE: I mean, that is --WILLIAMS: It seems to me if you say, oh, gee whiz, where are your taxes? Oh, what about these casinos and the bankruptcies? What about not paying your debts to people? All people say, well, gee, I don't know. Now it's like who is to be believed? But if you really stick to Hillary on the judgment issue, I think it might have some. But at this business about conspiracies and Jim Comey is a bad guy and Loretta Lynch has been bribe? I think people think you know what?GUTFELD: This is --WILLIAMS: This is madness.GUTFELD: What you're saying is exactly with Benghazi. You stick to who pushed the video and you're OK with this; Trump has got stay away from the conspiracies. He's got the golden goose in Hillary. Comey is your homey. Everything he says --GUILFOYLE: Oh.GUTFELD: Everything he says helps you, but you don't need the other stuff. You don't need --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: You know, you don't need to, you know, to dress it up anymore than it is. And the danger is that Hillary's life preserver will become Trump by going off on (inaudible). She's got to focus. This is the biggest gift to him. It's like, you know, she -- Comey gave Hillary on a silver platter.GUILFOYLE: Correct.GUTFELD: Don't drink from the faucet.GUILFOYLE: By just using it to say it's just, you know, is rigged. Look at the outcome here.GUTFELD: That's helpful.GUILFOYLE: It was predictive in terms of, you know, that this would happen. And there is some cause to say, look at the conflict of interest here.GUTFELD: Yeah.GUILFOYLE: You know Loretta Lynch was appointed, originally, by Bill Clinton. He's on a plane with her. Nobody talks about the grandkids for 35 minutes like that with oh, let me go. Let's find the AG just --GUTFELD: They're awesome grandkids.GUILFOYLE: . use this.WILLIAMS: You know if you guys --GUILFOYLE: Oh, OK.WILLIAMS: Let me say, if the republicans had Kasich, if you had Bush, if -- I don't care who you had, but you got Trump and it's just hard to make the case against Clinton if you're looking at Donald Trump and his bankruptcies and it's refused that they released tax returns.BOLLING: Well -- OK.GUILFOYLE: OK.BOLLING: Donald Trump beat Kasich include -- and Bush.WILLIAMS: I noticed. And I just, I just thinking -- at this point you are thinking --GUTFELD: And he praised Saddam, which I thought was very brave.(LAUGHTER)GUTFELD: Very brave.WILLIAMS: OK.GUTFELD: Blame Bush for 9/11 and praise Saddam. He's got my vote.(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: I'm sure you (inaudible).WILLIAMS: Oh.(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Can I go home now?(LAUGHTER)WILLIAMS: Can I go home?GUILFOYLE: Juan, yes.WILLIAMS: Oh my, God.BOLLING: Yes?GUILFOYLE: Yeah.BOLLING: I will second that (ph).(LAUGHTER)GUILFOYLE: Next, did President Obama put pressure on the FBI to clear Hillary Clinton? Were we talking about that? He says he didn't. But he publicly stated how he thought the investigation should turn out; that flashback -- ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BOLLING: She lied about sending and receiving top secret information. She lied to the FBI was only conducting a security review. She lied that she only used one device to e-mail. She lied that her server definitely wasn't hacked. We now know for sure that Hillary Clinton bracingly put her national security at risk. So what does that make here according to the president of the United States? The most qualified candidate in American history, of course.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hillary Clinton has been tested.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: She has seen up close to what is involved in making those decisions. She has seen the consequences of things working well and things not working well. And there has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)OBAMA: Ever.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: You can't make this up. Who wrote that script for him to say that?GUTFELD: He knows --BOLLING: The most qualified?GUTFELD: Well, he said any man or woman and that's very, very heteronormative, because that was -- it's just there are other choices. Also, she's been tested, for what?(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: What has she been tested for, measles? I don't know. And he also didn't specify what office. He said, she would -- it was, she was more qualified in this office, but he really didn't say which office --BOLLING: That's right. He was in North Carolina, (inaudible) North Carolina.PERINO: Yes.BOLLING: Maybe the office of the Of the DMV's office --(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Could have been the DMV.BOLLING: Yes, or the DMV's.GUILFOYLE: Oh my, gosh. The leader --GUTFELD: I was trying to help him now.GUILFOYLE: The leader-in-chief? No. No. Can you actually -- can you imagine the leading all the DMV information -- very problematic.GUTFELD: That would help me.GUILFOYLE: I don't think so.GUTFELD: Believe me.(LAUGHTER)(CROSSTALK)GUTFELD: Get a license.GUILFOYLE: Exactly.BOLLING: Should be the most disqualified.GUILFOYLE: And it's kind of a dis to himself, isn't it? I mean, because all I kept saying to myself is a community organizer. Told you. That was the problem. And he said that she's more qualified.GUTFELD: The bar is so low that even Dana can't walk under it.BOLLING: Very nice, very nice.Juan, what makes her -- what makes her the most qualified?WILLIAMS: Boy, I mean, I don't know where to start. The woman's been -- she was a United States senator. But in addition, she's been secretary of state. She spent eight years in the White House as first lady. Right?BOLLING: That's experience, but not qualifying.WILLIAMS: No, no, no. We're talking about qualifications, right? What you put on a resume. You asked me what makes her the most qualified? I'm answering the question.I mean, in addition to which, of course, the years she spent with her husband while he was governor of Arkansas. And she has been a private lawyer and successful as a private lawyer. So I think that she's eminently qualified.What you guys are talking about and mocking, I understand is she displayed reckless judgment, according to the FBI director.GUTFELD: Exactly.BOLLING: So Dana, can I...GUILFOYLE: Thank you, Juan.BOLLING: ... take Juan's very, very long resume that he portrayed? Qualify -- experience equals qualified?PERINO: I mean, you've had, like -- if you look at the range of candidates that the Republicans had in the primary this year, 17 of them, lots of different types of experience. We are going to -- we have a nominee that is outside the box, outside Washington. And that actually became, in the exit polls, the most important quality for Republican voters in the primary, was that they wanted somebody from outside of Washington.So I don't know if the qualifications...BOLLING: Right, so...PERINO: ... that Juan just listed actually are the ones that Americans are actually looking for.BOLLING: It's a different job description. Maybe people are looking for the outsider, which would make him the most qualified.PERINO: Can I add one other thing?BOLLING: Yes.PERINO: Well, I just want to say that, if you -- to take a moment and realize, President Obama is a huge asset to her on this campaign trail. There is one of the B-roll from the crowd was amazing. But there's a shot from the A.P. of -- a photograph of all these people, oversold crowd, right? With their hands up in the air, taking pictures of the president and Hillary Clinton so that they could get a look. There is enthusiasm. He's one of the first two-term presidents that is going to actually be active on the campaign trail. It's a huge net plus for her.GUTFELD: It's got to drive her crazy. They like her. They like him. And then she's up there and, like, "meh."WILLIAMS: By the way, Dana. Let me just ask Dana. Dana, just tell the audience his approval numbers, just in case they missed it.BOLLING: It's good.PERINO: It's like 53 percent.BOLLING: Stay right there, because you came up with the right term I was looking for. President Obama guaranteed there be would no political influence on the FBI's investigation, but he sent signals as to what the outcome should be. Here's what the president said on FOX News back in April.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Hillary Clinton was an outstanding secretary of state. She would never intentionally put America in any kind of jeopardy.I continue to believe that she has not jeopardized America's national security. Now what I've also said is that -- and she's acknowledged -- that there's -- there's a carelessness in terms of managing e-mails that she has owned and she recognizes.(END VIDEO CLIP)BOLLING: Now Dana, you came up with the right analogy. It's called what?PERINO: Working the ref.BOLLING: Did he do that?PERINO: Yes. And in fact, actually, I think that, if you pulled up THE FIVE's show from the day that we talked about the president's interview there, that we said the same thing. That it wasn't just our words. It was the FBI on background was saying, "Mr. President, please stop. We don't need your help. You're going to sully the investigation. If you try to put your thumb on the scale, you're going to cause a problem for us."BOLLING: Sure.GUILFOYLE: It's improper. You shouldn't comment on a pending investigation. But do you love the little buzz words, the little phrases you heard?BOLLING: Careless.GUILFOYLE: Careless.BOLLING: Careless.GUILFOYLE: Careless. And that she would never intentionally, but she was careless. It came right out of the Comey script.BOLLING: Comey said, right? Excessively careless. What did he say? Excessively careless?GUILFOYLE: Yes.PERINO: Excessively.GUTFELD: Extremely.GUILFOYLE: Extremely careless.WILLIAMS: The president just had the right analysis.BOLLING: Or -- OK, he's very prescient.WILLIAMS: No, I'm just saying it's the same analysis that Comey eventually delivered.BOLLING: The point is, he should spend more time on FOX News and be more prescient so we know what to expect.GUILFOYLE: The same messaging, you know, verbatim. Hello. That's just more evidence of this.BOLLING: Are we good to go?GUTFELD: Yes, I'm fine.BOLLING: All right. Let's go now.GUILFOYLE: Go to ISIS.BOLLING: ISIS extended its global wave of terror during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, launching attacks in eight countries that have killed literally hundreds. According to our State Department, it's a sure sign that we're winning the war, right? We'll try and figure that one out later.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: A rescued hostage at the Holey Artisan Bakery said those who he could recite a verse from the Koran were spared, the others, tortured and killed. This amidst other grim events: in Istanbul; the Tel Aviv attack where maniacs planned to dip their knives in rat poison. Suicide bombers hit three Saudi cities; a grenade attack in Malaysia. The worst, in Baghdad: 200 were killed when a truck packed with explosives blew up in a shopping hub where victims were celebrating. That's more than Paris and Orlando combined, all during Ramadan.But by the numbers, Muslim victims outnumber non-Muslims. So if Islamists kill more Muslims than anyone, why accuse Americans of Islamophobia? Isn't it the Islamists who are Islamophobic?I say this as people criticize our outrage for mentioning Islam with terror. But how can our outrage offend them when we are outraged for them. But as this holy period ends -- thank Allah -- no doubt, Islamists will find other reasons to kill Muslims. Homosexuality, learning to drive, blasphemy -- the Sharia don't like it, mocking the old law.Terror cells are now in Europe and at least 17 ISIS militants have infiltrated there, disguised as refugees. Yet, our State Department claims the recent attacks, they're signs of desperation:(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ANTONY BLINKEN, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: We're seeing, I think, is ISIS actually lashing out, because against every way we measure this -- the territory they control, the number of foreign fighters and fighters overall, the money, the propaganda -- they are down against every single measure. And unfortunately, one of the things that they do in response is to lash out with these indiscriminate terrorist attacks. In a strange way, this is a measure of the success we're having in taking their territory away from them, taking the foreign fighters away, taking the resources away.(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Call that whistling in the dark: Seeing the widening scope of terrorism and the self-activation of sleeper cells as some sort of success. If that's progress in the war against terror, imagine what failure would be.Juan, the sooner we eradicate ISIS and kill all Islamist terrorists, the better it is for Muslims, no?WILLIAMS: I think it -- I don't see that there's any dispute there. I was listening to you so intently, because I think that what Mr. Blinken said is accurate. That they have less territory, less fighters, less money and that they are, therefore, resorting to guerrilla warfare-type tactics, which means that they go out and they, say, especially during Ramadan, as you pointed out last week, go and do something you know. "You lone wolves. It doesn't take our instruction. Go do it."So we can take away their control and command. We can take out their leaders, and we've been doing a good job of it. But it -- the result is the sad horrible consequence because of their terrible, cancerous ideology that's being spread even as they're going down.GUILFOYLE: Yes, and guess what? ISIS is doing more with less. How about that? How horrifying. They're actually increasing body counts and their expectations with less resources. That tells you how deadly they are. It tells you how flawed our campaign and strategy is against ISIS. Because they are managing, almost on a daily basis, to hit hard internationally so no soil is safe, whether it's Muslim soil or American soil. They continue to bleed everybody out.I feel worse now.BOLLING: But there's a silver lining, according to Juan, in the Obama administration, we're this close to defeating them. We almost got them. You know, a little more love. Loretta Lynch says a little more love and maybe they'll go down.WILLIAMS: No other question. To my mind, I was listening to Kimberly there, is that we are destroying their capacity to build this caliphate that they say they want to build. OK? And so what they do now is they go out and they commit these horrific crimes.BOLLING: What's worse?WILLIAMS: Well, that's the question. Because what Kimberly was saying is do you have a strategy?BOLLING: Because if this is winning, what's to lose?WILLIAMS: Kimberly says do you have a strategy? And my thought was it's hard to come up with a strategy when you can just say to people, "Oh, yes," especially during Ramadan, "this is a time to go for Allah and go kill people and even kill other Muslims in greater numbers than you're killing Christians."BOLLING: Can I also point out one thing also?GUILFOYLE: Solution: Crush them and destroy them and burn them alive in Raqqah. That's what you do. That's what McCain said to do.WILLIAMS: But even if you do, even if you destroy them, they -- the ideology continues to percolate.BOLLING: Scholars will tell you, if you're a, quote unquote, "moderate Muslim" and you turn in a Muslim who has a jihad, who's about to perform a jihad, you can be considered the enemy, as well. The infidel, as well. And maybe during Ramadan, no moderate Muslim who sees or hears something will say something.GUTFELD: Yes. Let me -- I'm going to roll to this. This is President Obama talking about ISIS infiltrating Europe. I believe that's the SOT.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)OBAMA: Even as we work for peace, we have to deal with the realities of the world as it is. And we can't forget what's at stake in Afghanistan. This is where al Qaeda is trying to regroup. This is where ISIL continues to try to expand its presence. If these terrorists succeed in regaining areas in camps where they can train and plot, they will attempt more attacks against us. We cannot allow that to happen.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: So the president today is basically saying, "When I said we were going to end the war in Afghanistan, I'm going to have to backtrack on that, because my mistake of leaving in Iraq too soon led to the situation we have now, and not enforcing the red line in Syria led to the international crisis of the refugees infiltrating Europe."GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: And I think what -- what Mr. Blinken was talking about sounds really good at the Council on Foreign Relations.GUTFELD: Yes.PERINO: And everybody sits there and nods and drinks their coffee and says, "Oh, that was such a great speech. Thank you so much."To the rest of us, we're thinking, wait, if they're doing more with less and killing more of us with less structure, how much worse can it get? And I think the role of the government has to be to have an imagination and to think ahead.So if you allow Assad to stay there, and then ISIS has a safe haven to plot and plan attacks, it doesn't matter if you cut off the heads. Because they adapted. We have to adapt, too.President Obama is going to leave troops in Afghanistan but not, I don't think, give them enough of what they need to win. And I don't think it will be enough, and they're not going to change the rules of engagement.GUILFOYLE: And just like the problems that we had in Iraq, where they didn't have the proper status of forces agreement and not enough troops to be able to sustain, maintain order and help our partners.PERINO: And while they say that ISIS has less territory, the Taliban has much, much more.GUILFOYLE: Resurgence in Afghanistan, as well, another crisis. Well done.GUTFELD: All right. Great news.Breaking news on Donald Trump's V.P. search when "The Five" returns.GUILFOYLE: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)BOLLING: I don't know.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: Less than two weeks away from the Republican National Convention, and boy, the buzz about Donald Trump's V.P. pick, it's intensifying. And it's not going to be Tennessee Senator Bob Corker. He withdrew himself from consideration today, and so did Iowa Senator Joni Ernst. Ernst says she wants to focus on her work in the state.Meanwhile, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Indiana governor Mike Pence, they are still on the short list.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: This is all up to Donald Trump. He'll pick who he wants. He'll pick it based on what he wants, both to win the election and to govern.GOV. MIKE PENCE (R), INDIANA: Well, look, let me say, we had a great time. It was such a privilege for us to be able to spend time with a man that I hope will be the next president of the United States.(END VIDEO CLIP)WILLIAMS: Kimberly tried to get the scoop from Donald Trump earlier.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP (via phone): I'm actually looking at 10 people, and there or four called me up. Very big names: Senate and governors and all. And they want to be considered, and we're looking very, very strongly.I like the generals. I like the concept of the generals. We're thinking about -- actually, there are two of them that are under consideration. We really were looking to go more the political route, in terms of getting legislation passed, which is what they do. And I think, frankly, we don't want to do the executive orders, like Obama's been doing. He just sits down, signs executive orders all day long. That's not the way it's supposed to work. So...(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Hmm.WILLIAMS: Well, Kimberly...GUILFOYLE: Yes.WILLIAMS: ... you talked to him, so what did you take away?GUILFOYLE: And that's what you do with Mr. Trump. You let him talk, right? I mean, you do. You let him talk, because he's very open with giving information. And what I thought was very interesting today was he said the list has expanded to ten people. This is even in light of the news of Corker and Ernst withdrawing themselves from consideration. I don't think they were going to be the pick anyway, to begin with. But definitely people of high caliber to be considered amongst that group of esteemed individuals.WILLIAMS: Well, but Eric, I thought, in fact, he was trying to seduce Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, because it would help him. He had Corker on his big jet yesterday. He had him at the event in North Carolina.GUILFOYLE: He introduced him.WILLIAMS: And Corker said he was awed by the Trump crowd, but then he says, "I'm not doing it. I don't want..."BOLLING: Yes, he said not doing it. Also, Donald Trump, the rumor was that General Michael Flynn was one of the people on the short list, as well, but you heard Donald tell Kimberly he pushed away from the generals; he wants the political.Look, I think Newt Gingrich gives him...GUILFOYLE: That's two on the list.BOLLING: Newt gives him very inside politics. That's the area that he -- you know, he comes from the outside, so he wants to be able to have some sort of -- I don't know -- success inside Washington.I like Newt. I think he's wonderful; he's brilliant. But I also think Marco Rubio gives him Florida, which I think he desperately needs. I know he doesn't want to do it. but you never know, unless -- until you're asked.PERINO: Right.WILLIAMS: But you don't want to get embarrassed by being turned down.BOLLING: Well, you don't do it in public.GUILFOYLE: You wouldn't -- Juan...WILLIAMS: That's what happened -- that's what happened with Corker.BOLLING: Remember when you went to prom?WILLIAMS: Me?BOLLING: Yes. You didn't ask a girl to prom...GUILFOYLE: You don't ask them until you do a little advance work to find out it's a yes.WILLIAMS: Yes. Well, anyway, someone who is picking up is Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Dana. What do you think?PERINO: Well, again, I think that, when -- when you go to pick -- sorry. First day back from vacation. When you go to pick somebody as your vice president, what is the most important thing to consider? Is you have to have somebody that can govern.And that doesn't have to be a governor. It doesn't have to be a senator, necessarily, but it has to be somebody that can step in and fill the role in the event that you're unable to perform your duties as the commander in chief.So I actually don't think it's going to be anybody that we've heard about so far. I think Donald Trump likes a surprise and that we should all be prepared that it's somebody that you haven't heard of yet.WILLIAMS: So Greg, give me your pick for Donald Trump.GUTFELD: Still waiting for the call.GUILFOYLE: Yes, by the way.GUTFELD: Yes.GUILFOYLE: Go about your daily activities.WILLIAMS: Hey, wait a second.GUTFELD: I hear through the grapevine he wants to reach out, but he's just a little scared. And it's OK; you can call me, Donald.But I think -- I still think that Newt is the big one. Because you need somebody to navigate...GUILFOYLE: Biden likes him.GUTFELD: ... D.C., the turf which, you know, Trump isn't familiar with. But I came up with two headlines for "The New York Post." For Corker, "Uncorked." And if Pence doesn't do it, "Ex-Pence."GUILFOYLE: OK.WILLIAMS: Well, I say Gutfeld for vice president.GUTFELD: There you go.WILLIAMS: "One More Thing," up next.GUTFELD: I'm in.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: It's time now for "One More Thing." I'll go quickly. President George W. Bush turned 70 today. Happy birthday to him. I think we -- he spent the day mountain biking with some wounded warriors, like he's down on his ranch in Crawford, Texas. And I just want to wish him a very, very happy birthday.BOLLING: Excellent.WILLIAMS: Happy birthday.GUILFOYLE: Happy birthday.PERINO: And that's a picture his daughter posted today, and she looks beautiful.GUILFOYLE: Very nice.PERINO: Greg, you're next.GUTFELD: All right, roll that thing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Greg's Crime Corner(END VIDEO CLIP)GUTFELD: Now roll the music, please.(MUSIC: THEME FROM "CHiPS")GUTFELD: All right. Great news. Erik Estrada -- keep playing it. Erik Estrada, Ponch -- remember Ponch? -- actually has now joined a real police force in Idaho. He's a reserve officer in Idaho.PERINO: That's awesome.GUTFELD: He'll be fighting -- he'll be fighting online predators who seek out children.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my...GUTFELD: I think you can -- that's a good thing to do, right?PERINO: Absolutely.BOLLING: He was "CHiPS," right? Now he's "IPS."GUTFELD: Yes, he's "IPS." Nicely done. All right.GUILFOYLE: Oh, my goodness.GUTFELD: From "CHiPS" to "IPS."PERINO: All right. Juan Williams.GUILFOYLE: I'd stay out of Idaho, Greg.WILLIAMS: So, you know, last weekend, Fourth of July weekend, you know, I wanted to go watch the fireworks in Washington, so I got permission to go up to the top of the National Cathedral...PERINO: Wow.WILLIAMS: ... the highest point in the city, and took my family. And but guess what?GUILFOYLE: Rain.WILLIAMS: It was so overcast, so much rain we didn't see a thing. But you know what? There's some of my family.But I've got to tell you something. Being at the top of the National Cathedral, stunning. You should do this one. I don't think you can do it in the public, but it's an awesome experience to be at the top and see America from that perspective.PERINO: All right. K.G.GUILFOYLE: Beautiful. His, like, "One More Things" are very good.GUTFELD: Not yours.GUILFOYLE: Unlike mine today. So "Kimberly's Food Court."(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)GRAPHIC: Kimberly's Food Court(END VIDEO CLIP)GUILFOYLE: I could be super excited, but I'm not, because apparently it was also fried chicken day or something, right?
