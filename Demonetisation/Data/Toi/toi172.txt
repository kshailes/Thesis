  NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday granted bail to a businessman, who was in custody of the Enforcement Directorate since June 2017 in connection with a post-demonetisation money laundering case.
  
  
  Justice Mukta Gupta also held the custody of accused Yogesh Mittal as "illegal" from August 11-31, 2017.
  

  The high court released Mittal on bail on a personal bond of Rs one lakh with two sureties of the like amount, subject to the satisfaction of the Special Court.
  

  Mittal, who is in the ED custody since his arrest on June 5 for the offence of money laundering, had sought regular bail.
