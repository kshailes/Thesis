Economic Survey: 10 new facts on Indian economyThe Economic Survey, which sets the stage for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's annual budget on Thursday (February 1), forecast that economic management will be challenging in the coming year.



  "Taking seasonality into account it is found that there is a 0.8 per cent monthly trend increase in new tax filers (annual growth of nearly 10 per cent). The level of tax filers by November 2017 was 31 per cent greater than what this trend would suggest, a statistically significant difference," said the Economic Survey 2017-18 released by the government today.
  

  As per the Economic Survey analysis, new filers reported an average income, in many cases, close to the income tax threshold of Rs 2.5 lakh, limiting the early revenue impact.

  "As income growth over time pushes many of the new tax filers over the threshold, the revenue dividends should increase robustly," it added.
  

  Since November 2016, 1.01 crore (10.1 million) filers were added compared to an average of 62 lakh (6.2 million) in the preceding six years. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had also scaled up its liquidity absorption operations using a mix of both conventional and unconventional instruments post note ban.
