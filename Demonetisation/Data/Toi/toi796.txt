  Here is a ready reckoner for all you need to know about economic survey:
  

  1) Ahead of the Union Budget, the finance ministry every year presents the economic survey which reviews the overall state of the economy in the last 12 months and highlights the policy initiatives of the government and the prospects of the economy in the short to medium term.
  

  2) Last year, for the first time, the government presented a mid-term economic survey in the month of August.

  3) The major attraction of the economic survey will be the growth rate of GDP for this financial year. The GDP rate came under scrutiny as it hit a 3-year low in the first quarter.
  

  4) The government will also provide predictions on other key macroeconomic indicators like inflation, fiscal deficit and expectation from RBI on lending rates.
  

  5) This year's economic survey is expected to be a sort of report card for demonetisation and GST, two economic reforms which created disruption in 2017-18 financial year.
  

  6) The Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian will brief the media at 1.30 pm, after the tabling of the survey.
