Union Budget 2018: Union Budget: Agra leather industries feel left out | Agra News - Times of India
			


  AGRA: Members of Agra's leather industry feel that they have been left high and dry by the Union Finance Minister as he has offered "nothing" for their industry, which is struggling to survive in the post demonetisation and 18% GST regime.
  
  
  According to shoe exporters and manufacturers, "the budget is completely political with nothing is being done for small and medium scale businesses". They feel that the Government's focus was only on agriculture and farmers, beside the big corporates.
  

  President of Agra Shoe Factors Association, Gaagan Das Ramani told TOI, "We were hoping to get some relief for the leather industry but that hasn't happened. The association members were demanding an increase in the annual turnover audit limit from Rs 1.5 crore to 2 crore, besides a hike in investment exemption limit from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh."
  

  Ramani said that they are now hoping that in the next GST Council meeting, the government will reduce the tax rate to 5% for footwear up to Rs 1000 and 12% for footwear costing more.
  

  Nazir Ahmad, chairman of Park Export and former president of Agra Footwear Manufacturer Exporters Chamber (AFMEC), also expressed similar views. He said, "We were expecting GST refund to be simplified. By saying that footwear industry will get all facilities will not solve our problems."
  

  However, Puran Davar, president of Agra footwear industry, said that 30% income tax allowance on new employment will reduce the labour cost and enhance transparency in employment. "It will also enhance competiveness," he said.
