Demonetisation destroyed poor, middle class: Scindia

Prime Minister Narendra Modi woke up one morning and decided he must do something toofani (dramatic) and he came up with demonetisation, which destroyed the poor and middle class of this country, said Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday. Mr. Scindia was in Andheri to campaign for party candidates contesting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections.He called demonetisation a gift to the rich and a blow to the poor. “They have wiped out the hard earned cash of common people. Is this the cashless India the BJP is aiming at?” he asked. “Looking at the massive response of the people, I can surely say that the voters are fed up of the Sena-BJP combine. It is now time for Congress to takeover.”Speaking in Marathi, Mr. Scindia said, “I am a Mumbaikar. I was born here. It’s been 20 years of an unholy alliance between the Sena and the BJP. They talk about cleaning the Ganga, but have not been able to provide water for 24 hours.”He said the PM’s motto was Dikhao sapna aur sabka maal karo apna [Show people dreams and seize all their wealth]. “We call this city the financial capital of India. But these two parties have not been able to give good roads. What we have here is only potholes.”Mr. Scindia said the BJP did not have a manifesto. “It only tries to play Ram Mandir politics when elections draw near. Why did Modi offer a shawl to Nawaz Sharif? Four of our soldiers are martyred in Kashmir and have you seen any action from our side?” “The ongoing so-called fight between the Sena and the BJP is a joke. These parties had no problem for 20 years and suddenly they feel that the other is corrupt.”
