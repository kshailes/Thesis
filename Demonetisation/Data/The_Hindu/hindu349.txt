Demonetisation: Prakash Raj seeks apology for ‘biggest blunder of our time’

 Actor Prakash Raj on November 8 penned a note demanding an apology from the authorities for the “disruptive impact” of the demonetisation exercise.The 52-year-old national award-winning actor took to Twitter to question the intent behind the move of the government on November 8, 2016, which rendered 86% of the currency in circulation illegal.Once again titled as “To Whomsoever It May Concern”, Mr. Raj’s post read, “While the rich found ways to convert their black money into shiny new notes, this disruptive impact made millions suffer helplessly and the unorganised sector workers went for spin. Would you mind saying sorry for the biggest blunder of our time?”
