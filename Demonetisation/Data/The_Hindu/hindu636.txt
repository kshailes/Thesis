No let-up in queues at banks, ATMs

 With banks remaining open on Sunday, the quest for the prized lower denomination notes continued, with people queuing up to exchange the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. ATMs remained “out of order” in several places, with the few working ones attracting large crowds. Post offices across the State, which have also been roped in to exchange the notes, will remain open on Monday, which would have otherwise been a holiday in view of Guru Nanak Jayanti.Traders struggle Traders have been hit hard by the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. With farmers from whom they buy stocks from refusing to sell vegetables without valid change, shopkeepers in Russel Market said they have been left only with old stock of vegetables. “The farmers have told us that they will not be able to deliver the vegetables to us from Monday if we don’t have change. Farmers say they cannot exchange the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes as there are too few banks in Kolar and Devanahalli where they come from. We buy vegetables worth Rs. 3 lakh every day,” said Idrees Choudhry, secretary, Russel Market Traders’ Association. Traffic police not to insist on spot finesThe city traffic police, meanwhile, have decided to ease inconvenience to traffic rule violators. R. Hitendra, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic), announced on a micro-blogging site on Sunday morning that the traffic police would not insist on spot fines for a while until the situation settles down. Traders’ association gesture A small attempt was made towards helping those really in need of money exchange their old notes. The Russel Market Traders’ Association gave out smaller denomination notes worth Rs. 90,000 to people who could not stand in the long queues in banks but were in dire need of money. The association said the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes could always be deposited in the bank later by the various trusts involved.
