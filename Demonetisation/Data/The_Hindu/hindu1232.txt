The company said it will update the details as per user feedback and availability of currency notes.According to a press release, Snapdeal will be using the cash that it receives through Cash on Delivery (CoD) service to operate this facility. The delivery of cash will be done one day after requesting for the service.“The service is a goodwill gesture by Snapdeal to allow users to easily access cash without having to queue up at their bank or at the ATMs. We will charge a nominal amount of one rupee as convenience fee, which will need to be paid through FreeCharge/through a debit card at the time of booking the order,” the company said in the release.A user can request Rs. 2000 per booking and any bank’s ATM card can be used to pay for the cash.
