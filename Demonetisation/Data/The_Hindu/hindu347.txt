Mixed bag for APMC traders: impact of demonetisation and GST 
The note ban implemented last year and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has had an uneven impact on the sale of vegetables, fruits and spices in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Vashi.Demonetisation has not had a huge impact on the sale and supply of fruits and vegetables, as they are kitchen staples.Besides, the daily consumer goods are also exempt from GST. But the two financial reforms have affected sales in the spice market seriously, say traders.Ishwar Masram, deputy secretary of the APMC Fruit Market, said, “Initially, at the time of the note ban, as well as a year later, there has been no significant effect on the fruit business, as we deal in a basic necessity. Similarly, the imposition of GST has no implications for the fruit market.”Dual blowBut a year on, the spice market at the APMC is still not stable.According to Amrish Barot, former chairman of the Bombay Mudi Bazar Kirana Merchants Association, “Demonetisation has had a great impact on the spice market. The small vendors who purchased spices in cash from the wholesale market have stopped doing so. We are facing a similar problem when it comes to GST, with the tax deterring buyers.”
