The numbers behind the move towards a ‘digital economy’

Backing the government’s decision to demonetise higher value currency notes, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant had, in November, said that the country is moving towards a totally digitised payment system that will accrue “huge gains” in the long term for the economy. Six months post demonetisation, it is time to take a look at how much the country has moved in that direction. Has there been an increase in the use of electronic payment systems? The Reserve Bank of India releases provisional data for electronic payments every month. This includes transactions conducted through debit and credit cards, unified payments interface (UPI), unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) and prepaid payment instruments (PPIs). Overall, there has been a fluctuation in the total number of transactions and its total worth. For eg, April saw digital transactions worth Rs. 109.58 trillion, a decline from March (Rs. 149.58 trillion). The actual number of transactions also fell from the previous month – From 893.9 million in March to 843.5 million in April. The month of November saw a total of 671.5 million transactions worth Rs. 94 trillion. Here’s month-wise data for digital transactions following demonetisation: MonthVolume(in million)Value(in Rs.
