Gowda makes light of Modi’s interest waiver announcement

 The former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda has likened Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of 60-day interest waiver for farmers who have taken loans from cooperative institutions to “appeasing a crying child with chocolates”.Speaking to presspersons here on Wednesday, Janata Dal (Secular) patriarch, who had welcomed the decision of demonetisation, said the Prime Minister’s address to the nation on the New Year’s Eve was like “budget announcement” as most of the announcements should have been made in Parliament.While praising the oratory skills of Mr. Modi, Mr. Gowda said this skill alone would not take him very far in the long run. “People have become restless,” he said.Accusing the Centre of misusing the Central Bureau of Investigation, he said that recent incidents in West Bengal testifies this.
