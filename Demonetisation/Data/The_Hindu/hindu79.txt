Hard work is more powerful than Harvard : Modi 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said, “hard work is more powerful than Harvard” as the latest GDP data shows demonetisation did not affect growth rate, rather the figures improved.“On the one hand are those [critics of note ban] who talk of what people at Harvard say, and on the other is a poor man’s son, who through his hard work, is trying to improve the economy,” he said at an election meeting in Maharajganj.Also read: Amartya Sen terms demonetisation a despotic action“In fact, hard work is much more powerful than Harvard” he said.Mr. Modi's remark came against the backdrop of Professor of Economics and Philosophy at Harvard University and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen terming demonetisation a “despotic action that has struck at the root of economy based on trust.”On February 28, the government pegged the GDP growth at a higher than expected 7.1% for 2016-17, despite the cash blues, which was higher than China’s 6.8% for October-December period of 2016, making India retain the tag of the world’s fastest growing economy.

 “Gift and bonus”On the electoral politics in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Modi said the electorate had ensured the BJP’s victory in the first five phases and now they would give surplus votes as “gift and bonus” in the remaining two rounds.“I request the voters of the State to give the rest of the two phases as bonus to the party. This is similar to the chillies and coriander leaves, which the vegetable seller gives to the buyer as bonus,” he said drawing applause from the crowd.A few days back, the Prime Minister spoke of the possibility of a hung Assembly in the State, saying that the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party were waiting for such an opportunity for bargaining. This prompted Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to comment that after dreaming of 300-plus seats, Mr. Modi is now talking about a fractured verdict.
