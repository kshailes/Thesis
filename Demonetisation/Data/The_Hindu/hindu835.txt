50% jump in smuggling of currency, reveals DRI 
 The recently-released data by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Customs show a 50 per cent jump in smuggling of Indian, foreign and counterfeit currency notes over the previous years. The data also reveals a 100 per cent rise in smuggling of narcotics, electronic, fabrics, and aircraft parts. Nearly ₹36.87 crore of foreign currency notes was seized in 2016, as opposed to ₹25.09 crore in 2015. The seizure of Indian notes was to the tune of ₹6.85 crore in 2016 as against ₹3.71 crore in 2015, while the seizure of counterfeit Indian notes rose to ₹2.72 crore in 2016 from ₹1.24 crore in the previous year. The biggest haul was reported at the IGI Airport on January 5 when two passengers were caught with ₹1 crore of foreign notes. Officials said the figures are for the financial year 2014, 2015 and 2016 (up to March). “The figures do not mirror the impact of demonetisation. We believe the rise is owing to increased seizure based on tip-offs and close coordination with other agencies,” said a senior official of the DRI, Mumbai Zonal Unit.The recent seizures of gold and currency notes in Mumbai, Delhi, Goa and Tamil Nadu have all been based on specific inputs targeted at syndicates operating in Dubai. The syndicate is found to be using passengers as mule, officials said. However, gold smuggling post demonetisation has in fact upped substantially starting of 2017, and the jump will be reflected in next year’s figures. On January 9, the gold that was seized in Tamil Nadu was arriving from Dubai and it weighed three kilograms. Another seizure of gold at Mumbai airport, which weighed 6.5 kg, was too found arriving from Dubai. The DRI Mumbai apprehended a 26-year-old youth carrying 4.9 kg gold when arriving from Dubai. “We have even seized (near Mandapam) 8.7 kg gold arriving in a boat from Sri Lanka,” said an official.
