Digital transaction charges will reduce further, says Javadekar

 Human resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday said digital transaction charges were set to reduce further and the process itself simplified.“We have already reduced the charges for digital transactions as our earlier system was not only rigid, but also had heavy charges. The charges are set to get further reduced as our aim is to make digital transactions very easy and without any charges,” Mr. Javadekar said at a press conference here on the occasion of the first anniversary of demonetisation of high-value currency notes. He said one would have to wait till the next budget to get benefits. Describing demonetisation as a historic move to curb corruption and black money, he said the war against corruption would continue.Attacking the Congress for observing demonetisation anniversary as ‘black day’, Mr. Javadekar said, “While we are observing anti-black money day, the Congress is opposing it. This shows that the Congress is for black money and corruption.” He described the tussle between the BJP and the Congress over demonetisation as a “war between two political cultures”.  ‘Jayant Sinha is clean’ Mr. Javadekar defended Union Minister of State Jayant Sinha, whose name figures in the ‘Paradise Papers’ list.“He is a very clean person. There is no case against him,” Mr. Javadekar told presspersons here. “Everybody whose name is on the list is not a culprit. There will be an inquiry based on which we will initiate action like we did in the Panama Papers case,” the Union Minister said.
