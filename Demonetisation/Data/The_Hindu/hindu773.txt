Modi should resign: Raghuveera Reddy

The Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) on Wednesday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi resign in accordance with his public proclamation that the people could give him any punishment if things did not get better 50 days after demonetisation a year ago.Addressing party workers and others after participating in a rally to mark November 8 as a Black Day in the city, Andhra Pradesh Congress President N Raghuveera Reddy said the demonetisation had unleashed tremendous hardship on the people. More than 120 persons died due to the hardship, 25 lakh people lost jobs, hundreds of industries closed down and the number of farmers suicides had increased because of the demonetisation. Mr. Reddy also found fault with the TDP and the YSRC for not raising their voice against the step which caused lot of inconvenience and hardship to the people. He recalled how Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu took credit for the scrapping of ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes.
