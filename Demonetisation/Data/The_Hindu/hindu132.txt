RSS, BJP leaders to go into a huddle over demonetisation 
The first week of the New Year appears to be one of introspection — especially on the significant decision of demonetisation taken by the Narendra Modi government — for both the BJP and its ideological mentor, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).The RSS brass, including its Sarsanghachalak (chief) Mohan Bhagwat and Sarkaryavah Suresh ‘Bhaiyaji’ Joshi, will sit down with the BJP’s senior general secretaries Ram Lal and Ram Madhav for the first of the three review meetings a year to be held in Ahmedabad on January 4 and 5, a day before the BJP kicks off its national executive meeting in New Delhi.Top sources in the Sangh Parivar have confirmed that the meeting will review the events of the year gone by, especially demonetisation and its likely impact on the situation on the ground this year.“Several affiliates of the RSS — such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch — expressed reservation about the impact of demonetisation on various sectors. The issues thrown up by demonetisation will also be discussed,” a source said.Structured meeting“While the RSS has had many discussions unofficially, this will be the first structured meeting,” he said. Mr. Mohan Bhagwat is, in fact, touring Gujarat now.The BJP national executive will meet on January 6 and 7, the first time since the government announced demonetisation.“Demonetisation will dominate the proceedings here, too, with a separate resolution on the issue, thanking the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for its tough stance on corruption,” said a source in the party. “A second, omnibus political resolution will also be moved, and it will specifically mention the obstructive behaviour of the Opposition during the just-concluded winter session of Parliament,” the source said.“Obviously, the preparations for the elections in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur will also be discussed,” said a party office-bearer.BJP president Amit Shah and Mr. Modi will address the meeting at the opening and concluding sessions of the meeting respectively. “Who will propose these resolutions is still to be decided,” said the source.
