SC to hear cooperative bank’s plea 
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the Villupuram District Central Cooperative Bank Ltd’s plea to deposit demonetised currency worth a little over ₹20 crore with the currency chest.A Bench led by Chief Justice of India J.S. Khehar heard the bank’s plea that the amount was the cash in hand at the establishment on November 8, 2016, when demonetisation kicked in.The bank challenged the RBI notification issued on November 8 that stated that demonetised notes shall cease to be legal tenders from the next day. It contended that the notification had the “effect of barring district central cooperative banks from depositing specified bank notes (SBNs)” with the currency chest.Though the notification had initially applied only to banking companies under the the Banking Regulation Act 1949, it was amended the next day to include co-operative banks as well. It had required the banks to “forward a return showing details of SBNs held” by them as on November 8 to the RBI before 1 p.m. on November 10 before the cash could be remitted to the currency chest. The bank, however, could file its returns only after 2 p.m. on that day and the notes were not accepted.
