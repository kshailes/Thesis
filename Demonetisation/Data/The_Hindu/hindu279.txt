Demonetisation a black day for Congress, says BJP

BJP State general secretary J. Syam Kishore said demonetisation had come as a shock for Congress leaders who amassed wealth through dubious means and it was certainly a Black Day for them as the wads of currency notes in their possession became illegal tender overnight. Participating as chief guest in the Anti-Black Money Day programme that signified the completion of one year of demonetisation here on Wednesday, Mr. Kishore said the nation was shaken by the 2G spectrum, coal, Bofors and many other scams, for which the Congress leaders were responsible.He said it was only those who suffered personal losses because of the demonetisation that faulted it while the others were forced to reflect the party’s view. BJP State Finance Committee convener Ch. Ramakotaiah said demonetisation had dealt a body blow to terror funding besides unearthing the black money within the country. BJP Kisan Morcha State president P. Tirupati Rao, party’s development committee convener U. Srinivasa Raju and others were present.
