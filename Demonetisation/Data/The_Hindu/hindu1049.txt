The face value of the Rs.1,000 denomination fake notes detected in that period was Rs.14.30 crore.Intelligence reportIn an affidavit to the Supreme Court, the government cited an intelligence report that said the objective of infusing FICN into India is to destabilise the economy, fund terrorists and to smuggle contraband.“There are reports of FICN being estimated to be about Rs.400 crore,” it said. “The FICN used towards terrorist financing has a hugely disproportionate impact on the economy. A few hours of a terrorist attack in Mumbai or in any other city leads to loss of human lives apart from the catastrophic impact on the economy.”
