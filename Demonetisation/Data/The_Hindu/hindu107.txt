‘Demonetisation has hit micro loans repayment’

: Demonetisation of high-value currency notes has hit repayments of micro loans, many of which originated in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh and were adversely impacted following political intervention by local leaders and rumours of loan waivers, Rating Agency ICRA has said.Separately, a Crisil study showed that nine per cent of micro enterprises are facing trouble servicing debt and paying salaries and unorganised players are expected to suffer most due to lower growth expectations in the second half of this fiscal.Pointing out that there has been a temporary disruption in the liquidity available in the hands of people, impacting near-term economic activity, ICRA said NBFCs’ inability to accept repayments in old currency, shortage of valid currency among borrowers, and disruption in borrowers’ regular business resulted in an adverse impact on the collection efficiency in the various retail loan pools securitised by NBFCs.Securitisation is the process of pooling various types of debt such as mortgages and car loans, and packaging that debt as bonds, pass-through securities, or collateralized mortgage obligations, which are then sold to investors.Analysing 182 live securitisation transactions, ICRA pointed out that micro loan, MSME loan and tractor loan pools witnessed sharp decline in collections. “While collection in micro loan sector is almost entirely in cash, collections in case of MSME loans of smaller ticket size and tractor loans also largely happens in cash,” ICRA said.“Median monthly collections of micro loan pools declined to 91 per cent from 99.8 per cent till September 2016. Collections of some pools declined to 50%-70% levels,” it said.Noting that the collection efficiency in ten pools dipped to less than 70 per cent, nine of which belonged to a single originator, ICRA said, “All these pools had sizable share of contracts originated in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, where the collections were adversely impacted following political intervention by some local leaders and rumours of loan waivers.”Further, high collection efficiency was reported in pools with weekly repayment cycles or for pools where collections were mostly completed prior to the announcement on demonetisation.“Collections in MSME loan pools also witnessed a sharp decline to 83 per cent from 95 per cent in the previous month,” the research agency said. Median collections across tractor loan pools declined to 84 per cent in November 2016 from around 95 per cent in the previous month. “Due to currency shortage, farmers either faced a loss of income due to reduced off-take (for perishable food items like fruits and vegetables) or delayed realisations (many farmers were forced to deposit their produce with the mandis on credit).”While collection for load against property pool declined to a small extent, collections in commercial vehicles and home loan pools were not much affected, it added.In November, some of the retail loan pools were not impacted much either because the borrowers paid the installment from the earnings of the previous month/ savings or because the installment date fell before or very close to the date of demonetisation announcement.Liquidity of MSMEs affectedAccording to a Crisil survey, which covered more than 1,100 MSMEs between November 24 and December 24, demonetisation has had an impact on liquidity of MSMEs. At least 9% of those surveyed, accounting for 6% of outstanding debt of the sample, said they will face issues in debt repayment. Most of these are micro enterprises with revenues below Rs 2 crore.Manish Jaiswal, Head-SME Ratings, CRISIL said, “Every fifth MSME surveyed planned to raise additional funding in the coming months, half of it for working capital. Interestingly, with unsecured loans from friends and associates drying up, 3 out of 4 respondents plan to approach banks for loans, while the rest will rely on internal accrual. That opens up a massive opportunity to banks currently awash in liquidity.”It further pointed out that every third MSME is also facing delay in receivables from clients, which has curbed their ability to repay creditors — and pay salaries — on time.“The steel sector was the most impacted on this score, with nearly two-thirds of respondents admitting to problems, followed by textiles, logistics and construction sectors. However, those engaged in human resource-based services such as recruitment agencies, security services and IT services had it relatively easy.”Unorganised players struggle moreThose affected the most are from the traditional sectors with high reliance on cash transactions such as textiles, agricultural products, steel, consumer durables, construction and automobiles.Unorganised players (less than 10 employees) are expected to struggle more than their organised counterparts, with 37% of them likely to report negative revenue growth in the second half compared with a quarter of organised players.“Yet, despite the hiccups, as many as 41% of those surveyed expect to do better in the second half of this fiscal, while 29% expect de-growth. Nearly two-thirds of them, from sectors such as pharmaceuticals, IT services, auto components, auto dealerships and consumer products, had reported good sales in the first half,” it said.Additionally, 41 per cent MSMEs have seen their clients shift to cheque or electronic mode of payment since demonetisation.“Most of them see only a short-term impact of demonetisation, and more than three-fourths believe it will be business as usual by June 2017,” Crisil said.Lower growthHowever, the respondents added that demonetisation will lead to lower growth, mostly on account of its impact on day-to-day operations.“Typically, MSMEs perform better in the fiscal second half (October to March), which means annual growth will be muted,” it said.The survey noted that nearly half of the MSMEs with annual turnover less than Rs 2 crore reported a greater shift towards less cash, compared with a third of those with revenue over Rs 25 crore.“This may also be because non-cash payments are already prevalent among mid-sized players. For the smaller ones, the shift is expected to translate into long-term benefits through quicker transaction processing and better record keeping,” Crisil said.
