Cash crunch hits even oranges 
 Cash crunch and sharp decline in supply from other places, particularly Nagpur, have jacked up the price of sweet orange in the city.Drop in the yield has further led to shortage in the supply of citrus fruits. Besides, the demonetisation move which came at the most inopportune time, right at the beginning of the peak season for the fruit, impacted its transport and arrivals from Nagpur. Lack of cash flow in the market has forced several wholesale merchants to manage with the limited stocks available. “Last year, we received dozen truckloads of oranges from Nagpur daily. But, it has come down to just five trucks this year as the season began in November, coinciding with the demonetisation move. Moreover, agents who have been supplying the fruits were insisting on cash payments rather than cheque payments,” says K. Mohan Rao, wholesale fruit merchant at Poorna market. The whole supply chain has been adversely affected due to cash crunch. Vendors who source the citrus fruits from the wholesale markets feel the pinch as the rate has soared. “A crate of oranges was priced at Rs.300 last November. However, the same quantity has been purchased at double the cost this season. Apparently, our business too has come down to 50 per cent compared to last year,” says V. Ramu, a fruit vendor. Roadside vendors said the trading was mostly based on cash transactions and demonetisation had left a great impact on their daily earnings. “We only hope that the sales would pick up in the next few weeks. Right now, we are able to sell oranges for Rs.30 to Rs.40 per kilo. At times, we will not be left with any profit but only try to get the cost incurred,” says P. Rambabu, fruit vendor at HB Colony. Retailers at Peda Waltair and Seethammadhara too have expressed similar concern over dip in the sale of the fruits.
