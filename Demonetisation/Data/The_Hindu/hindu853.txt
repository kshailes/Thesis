While Congress activists staged a protest near Gandhi Square, shouting slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, members of the CPI(M) and the Socialist Unity Centre of India (SUCI) gathered in front of the head post office at Nehru Circle. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers also staged a protest near the Regional Transport Office (West).Meanwhile, the City and District Congress Committees sent a memorandum to President Pranab Mukherjee against demonetisation through Deputy Commissioner D. Randeep. The sudden withdrawal of high denomination notes has caused severe livelihood problems for street vendors, small-time merchants, vegetable merchants, hawkers, rickshaw pullers, craftspersons, and farmers and agricultural labourers, the memorandum said, calling upon the President to direct the Centre to roll back the decision.
