Jan. 1: ATMs issue ₹4,500 in ₹500 denomination

 With the ATMs dispensing ₹4,500 per debit or credit card from Sunday, the situation at the centres across the city had turned easy. Much to the relief of the public, a majority of the ATMs are not only functional but also dispensed ₹500 notes.“May be because it was a holiday and New Year, the rush here was very low today and we were able to withdraw ₹4,500 without any delay. Luckily all the cash came in ₹500 notes which can put an end to change issue,” said A. Chandra Sekhar who withdrew money at an ATM in Autonagar.Multiple bank accounts“The increased limit is not a matter of concern for me as I don’t need such a huge amount often. Availability of ₹500 notes now is helpful,” said another person at the ATM.Meanwhile, people tried to withdraw more cash as it was payday and their accounts got credited with salaries. Those having multiple bank accounts managed to get more cash using all their cards to withdraw cash.“I have transferred some of the salary to two other bank accounts and withdrew the cash thrice and finally had more than ₹10,000 in hand,” said A. Surya, a private employee.On the other hand, the ATMs may witness rush on Monday as most of the salaries will be credited by banks.
