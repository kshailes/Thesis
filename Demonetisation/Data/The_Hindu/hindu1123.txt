Bankers to meet FinMin on liquidity 
The Finance Ministry will meet select bankers on Friday to discuss a new facility to drain surplus liquidity from the banking system arising out of the Centreâ€™s demonetisation move, bankers who are aware of the development told The Hindu.The new Standing Deposit Facility allows banks to park their excess funds with the RBI at a rate which is lower than the repo rate but without any collateral, a letter from the Department of Economic Affairs, which called the meeting, indicated. The repo rate is 6.25%. Currently, banks can get funds through the repo window from the RBI by using government securities as collateral.
