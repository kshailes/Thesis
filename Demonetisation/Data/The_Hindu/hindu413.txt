 The revenue of the Transport Department has come down by 4 per cent, due to demonetisation. Speaking to mediapersons on Friday, Transport Minister Sidda Raghava Rao said to enable cashless transactions, the department had introduced 160 swipe machines in the offices of the Regional Transport Officers in the State. He said people were unable to buy vehicles owing to cash crunch and thus the dwindling income of the department.
