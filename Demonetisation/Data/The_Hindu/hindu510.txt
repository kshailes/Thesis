Demonetisation has set India back 30 years: Goa Cong.

 The Congress here on Monday claimed that the demonetisation of currency notes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set the country 30 years back in time.Addressing a press conference here at the party headquaters, Goa Congress president Luizinho Faleiro said, “By this demonetisation, they have taken this country thirty years back. On Decemeber 31, we were expecting some good news for the people of the country. What we found were petty announcements keeping in mind assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Goa. The speech was empty and hollow.” Mr. Faleiro also said that the BJP-led coalition government in Goa was fraught with misrule.
