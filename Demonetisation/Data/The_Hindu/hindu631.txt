Indira proposed, Modi disposed: Siddaramaiah

Taking a dig at the demonetisation move by the Centre last year, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday said: “What Indira proposed, Modi disposed.” Comparing the nationalisation of banks by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the demonetisation of high-value currency by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Siddaramaiah said: “While Indira Gandhi opened the doors of banks to the poor through nationalisation, Modi closed them through demonetisation.”He was speaking at a programme organised by the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC)celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of the former Prime Minister. He said that Indira Gandhi had “sacrificed her life fighting for unity, equality and communal harmony”. “Fighting against divisive forces will be the right way to honour her,” he said. Congress State president G. Parameshwara said the pro-people programmes initiated by Indira Gandhi will be taken to every house and Mr. Siddaramaiah could make her dream come true by making the State “hunger-free”.Senior party leader and former Union Minister Jaffer Sharief attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party for “criticising the Congress without any basis”. Coffee-table bookMeanwhile, a coffee-table book on Indira Canteens is set to be published soon. Chirantana Media Solutions has documented the ambitious project in pictures. The book will be released shortly by Mr. Siddaramaiah, who announced that more than 500 Indira Canteens would be opened in all district and taluk centres from January 2, 2018.
