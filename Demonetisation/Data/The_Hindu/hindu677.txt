Congress convention to unveil protest strategy

 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi will announce a programme of action against the Modi government’s “anti-people policies” at the end of a day-long national convention here at the Talkatora Stadium on January 11. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who has been missing from a series of key party occasions recently, will be present at what has been named as Janvedna Sammelan, party general secretary C.P. Joshi announced on Saturday. This is part of the Congress’s continuing efforts to mobilise its rank and file on the impact of demonetisation, especially on the vulnerable sections of society and devise a plan on how to challenge the Modi government that has completed two-and-a-half years in office. Nearly 6,000 party representatives — members of the Congress Working Committee, State chiefs, Congress Legislature Party leaders, heads of frontal organisations, AICC members, MPs, MLAs, all those who contested the polls in 2014, media panellists and spokespersons — will attend the convention, Dr. Joshi said. In its lead-up, protests on the impact of demonetisation were held in front of government offices in all district headquarters on Friday and Saturday. On January 9, the party’s Mahila Morcha will organise protests at district headquarters to focus on the impact on women.At the convention, members from across the country will talk about the impact of demonetisation in their areas and make suggestions on how the second and third phases of mobilisation against the Modi government can be taken forward.
