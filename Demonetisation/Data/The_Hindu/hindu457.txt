It’s been just 10 days and money worth over Rs. 5,000 crore has already been deposited in banks... the banks will infuse this money in the markets,” he added.Mr. Modi said he did not take the decision to trouble anyone but for the good of the coming generations.Veiled attack on MamataIn remarks seen as a sharp attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Mr. Modi said that political leaders behind multi-crore chit fund scams were attacking him over demonetisation as they have been hit hard by the move.He also hit out at the Congress, saying the previous governments had kept quiet on the issue of black money because they were worried about losing power.Addressing a ‘Parivartan rally, ‘Mr. Modi cautioned people holding Jan Dhan accounts not to allow themselves to be used for laundering unaccounted money.“I know what sort of people are raising their voice against me? Does the country not know whose money was invested in chit fund business? Lakhs and crores of poor people invested money in chit funds.
