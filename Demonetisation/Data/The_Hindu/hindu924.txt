Some technical issues with regard to tax payment have come to light and the GST Network (GSTN) jave been directed to resolve them, he added.Authorities are also keeping a tab on the impact of GST on prices of various commodities. According to the minister, a team of 180 officials and 30 ministers, are on the job. “They are getting feedback from various districts and towns and trying to assess what kind of procedural difficulties businesses are facing. Procedural issues are sorted out by tax authorities as and when they arise,” he said at an event organised by PHD Chamber here.The GST which was touted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a ‘Good and Simple Tax’ - was rolled out on July 1. On GDP growth, he said manufacturing was hit in June because of destocking in light of GST implementation from July 1.The growth slumped to a three-year low of 5.7% during the April-June quarter- lagging China for the second straight quarter - as manufacturing slowed ahead of the GST launch amid the effect of demonetisation.Meghwal, however, expressed hope that economic growth will pick up in the next quarter.
