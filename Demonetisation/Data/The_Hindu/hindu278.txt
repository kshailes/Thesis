Mandya, Ramanagaram flay Centre’s demonetisation move

Alleging that demonetisation and policies implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government that negatively impact the poor have caused the country to regress, members of Congress party took to the streets across Mandya and Ramanagaram districts on Wednesday.To mark the first anniversary of the note ban, they staged ‘Black Day’ protests near the offices of the Deputy Commissioners on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway in Mandya and Ramanagaram, and at major junctions at all 11 taluk headquarters.The agitators shouted slogans against Mr. Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, which was announced on November 8, last year.Members from economically weaker sections of society had to bear the brunt of the devaluation of two currencies. The Centre should reveal the names of people those who had or have black money, they demanded.Members of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) also staged the demonstration in Mandya and condemned Mr. Modi and his government. They questioned the Centre about the benefits of demonetisation.However, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) members celebrated the first anniversary as ‘Anti-Black Money Day’ in Mandya.
