Volcano of people’s ire building up: Manik Sarkar 
 Describing demonetisation as a “gimmick”, Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar said “a volcano of people’s ire” is building up against the BJP-led NDA Government’s reluctance to address “real issues.”On an optimistic note, participating in an interactive session organised by Bengaluru Press Club here on Tuesday, Mr. Manik said that people had understood the grand design of diverting attention from real issues and dividing them on religion and caste lines and would react at an appropriate manner. “I admit that it will take some time, but I am confident that it would happen,” he said. Taking a dig at the Modi Government for “not respecting the federal structure”, he said no meeting of the National Development Council had been held so far. “The Inter-State Council, which met only once, did not do any transaction. Are these signs of federalism?” he asked. “They cannot mislead people for ever,” he said, adding that a third alternative comprising of Left and democratic forces would be the only alternative. Criticising Indian media, Mr. Manik said though over 15 crore workers participated in rallies organised by ten central trade unions to oppose “anti-people and anti-labour policies of the government”, media conveniently pushed the news under the carpet. But the global media had highlighted what it described as “the biggest ever working class assemblage to oppose the government,” he added.EOM
