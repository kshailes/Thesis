Request everyone to draw the cash they actually require. Overdrawal by some deprives others,” he said in another tweet.Last week, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the remonetisation situation with regard to replenishing the scrapped currency was “almost normal” now and the Reserve Bank of India was monitoring the supply on a daily basis.The government announced the withdrawal of old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes on November 8, 2016, with the aim to check black money, counterfeit notes and terror financing.
