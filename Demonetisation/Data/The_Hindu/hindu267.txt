Mamata calls up Yechury, but to no avail

A day after she urged all the Opposition parties, including the CPI(M), to unite against the Centre’s decision to demonetise Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 notes, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Sunday that she called up President Pranab Mukherjee.“The Honourable President was kind enough to take my call now. I briefed him about how common people are suffering because of demonetisation,” Ms. Banerjee said. The President has agreed to meet representatives of various political parties, she said on the social media.“I thank him for agreeing to meet representatives of political parties on November 16 or 17 where we will brief him in detail on the grim situation,” Ms. Banerjee said.In yet another step to unite the Opposition parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre, Ms. Banerjee also called up CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday.“Ms. Banerjee made a frantic call to Mr. Yechury today [Sunday] afternoon when he was travelling. The Chief Minister urged him to unite against the centre. But Mr. Yechury said that he would only be able to take a call on the matter after discussing it within the party,” CPI(M) Polit Bureau member and MP Md. Salim told The Hindu.The CPI(M) leadership is “sceptical” about Ms. Banerjee’s proposal, with top leaders in the State rejecting the Chief Minister’s proposal.
