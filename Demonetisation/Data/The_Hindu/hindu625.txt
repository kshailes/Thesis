Government targeted over note ban 
Opposition on Tuesday sought to corner the government over demonetisation, saying its claims that the note ban would help eradicate terrorism and fake currency had fallen flat on face.Initiating a discussion on Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2017-18 in the Lok Sabha, Congress member K. C. Venugopal wanted to know from the government how much demonetised currency had been deposited in the banks, how many new notes had been printed so far and how much black money unearthed.Likening demonetisation to “shooting on tyre of a fast moving car”, he said it was an “ill-thought out decision” of the NDA government and the entire country was facing “bad” economic situation in its aftermath with growth and job creation declining.
