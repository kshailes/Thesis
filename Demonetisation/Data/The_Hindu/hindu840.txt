RBI to provide Nepal Rs. 1 billion in Rs. 100 notes

 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has agreed to provide ₹1 billion in ₹100 notes to the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) to ease the acute shortage of ₹100 notes faced by the Himalayan nation, a media report said on Friday.The NRB’s plan to import ₹100 notes was delayed due to the Indian government’s move to demonetise ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes on November 8. As the RBI was under pressure to manage cash after demonetisation, it had told its Nepali counterpart that Nepal may have to wait till the situation normalised in India, The Himalayan Times reported.But, the RBI recently wrote to the NRB that it will be able to provide ₹1 billion in ₹100 notes, the paper said. The NRB officials have said the central bank is preparing to bring the amount within January. — PTI
