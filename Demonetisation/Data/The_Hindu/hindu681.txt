Banks had received ₹14.97 lakh crore as of the December 30 deadline for handing in the notes, Bloomberg reported.The Centre had put the value of withdrawn banknotes at ₹15.4 lakh crore.Referring to various “estimates”, the RBI said, “any estimate may not indicate the actual numbers.”The RBI also said its earlier figures “were based on aggregation of accounting entries done at the large number of currency chests all over the country.”The RBI had reported that as of December 10, withdrawn banknotes amounting to ₹12.44 lakh crore had been returned to the RBI and currency chests.
