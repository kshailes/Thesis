Demonetisation cuts terror violence by 60 p.c.: Union Minister

 Union Minister of State for PMO, North East, Atomic Energy and Space Jitendra Singh on Monday said November 8 demonetisation had paid rich dividends by slashing terror-related violence by 60 per cent and hawala transactions by 50 per cent.He told reporters on the sidelines of two-day national conference on e-governance here that two printing presses which were thriving on producing counterfeit notes in Pakistan had been shutdown.Stating that the people by and large were happy with the recall of high denomination notes, he said they were ready to bear the inconvenience for some more time as they understood the reason behind the bold decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to launch a crusade against black money and terror outfits.“There is drastic fall in terror activities sponsored by our enemies mainly in Jammu Kashmir. There is significant fall in Maoist activity. Now the entire world should understand how terror used to be aided and abetted by our neighbours, particularly Pakistan,” he said.“Now we are under transition. Lot of cash has come to the banks enabling us to spend more on developmental activities,” he stated.AP IT Minister Palle Raghunatha Reddy said the e-Pragati project being implemented by the State was aimed at using technologies to make AP among top three States in development by 2020, the topmost State by 2029 and the best State to live in the world by 2050.Union Secretary, Ministry of Electronics & IT Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Department of Department of Administrative Reforms & Grievances C.
