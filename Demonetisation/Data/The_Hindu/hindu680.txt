Brace for competition from fintech companies, Subbarao tells banks 
Former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India D. Subbarao on Thursday highlighted the need for banks to brace up to competition from financial technology firms, starting with a change in their attitude as, otherwise, “they will be challenged by these nimble-footed people who are coming.”Lean start-upsStating that a new generation of start-ups is aiming at the heart of the financial industry, Mr. Subbarao said fintech companies would compete with traditional banks on costs and use clever, new ways of assessing risks.Unlike the banks, they would not have the burden of geography, regulations and legacy systems.The former central banker, who was inaugurating an international conference at the IDRBT here, expected the advantage for banks in the form of access to low-cost funds and deposit mobilisation “to be neutralised by business models of fintech companies.” “They will compete on efficiency, service and on trust.”Banks, he said, can respond by improving efficiency and cutting costs. Acquiring fintech companies is also an option, he said, adding another, potentially possible, way for banks is to build linkages with new systems, new institutions such as payment banks, small finance banks.By doing so traditional banks could focus on wholesale lending or big retail lending, while engaging in small retail lending, in the hinterland, through the new institutions.DemonetisationMr. Subbarao said this pointing to how demonetisation had led to a flurry of innovation in the fintech space. The currency withdrawal was the most disruptive policy innovation undertaken in India since the 1991 reforms, he said.While its objectives, costs and benefits were the subject of a contentious debate, “what, however, is not contentious is that it is a disruptive policy innovation,” he said. The dilemma for regulators was how to promote innovation, protect consumers and preserve financial stability, he added.
