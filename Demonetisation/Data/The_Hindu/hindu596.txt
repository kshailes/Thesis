Modi responsible for 112 deaths: Mamata

 Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “responsible” for 112 deaths in the country after demonetisation, even as one more person died in the State while standing in a bank queue. “Modi Babu, you are totally arrogant. You are responsible for 112 deaths,” she tweeted. A list posted on the social networking site by the Chief Minister says 12 persons had died in the State after demonetisation. In a series of tweets, Ms. Banerjee questioned the restrictions on cash withdrawal, and said the government could not “snatch” the economic rights of the people. “Modi Babu, public are not beggars of your government. Why are there still restrictions on cash withdrawal?” she said.She said the 50-day time limit the Prime Minister had set for the ordeal brought on by demonetisation to end was over and wondered how the Centre could restrict the people’s right to withdraw their own money. One person died at Uluberia in Howrah district on Saturday after standing for hours in a queue in front of a rural bank, his family said. Police sources said Sanat Bag, 45, a resident of Basudebpur in Uluberia, “waited for long” before he collapsed and died on the spot.
