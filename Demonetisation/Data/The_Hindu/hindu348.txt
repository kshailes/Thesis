Kumbharwada remains stuck in the mud: on demonetisation and GST

Life in Kumbharwada remains stuck in the mud. The business of pottery, struggling due to demonetisation, has suffered a body blow because of the implications of the Goods and Service Tax.The Galwani family has been running their pottery business for long from Dharavi is no exception. Just when they thought they had managed to weather their initial losses and recover the business lost to demonetisation, the GST came along. Their business was back to square one. There are no customers for purchase of materials because GST has resulted rising cost of material, increasing their manufacturing costs.Abaaz Galwani said, “There are no customers. The business has seen a fall of 42%. We did change the business in some ways, but that too has not proved profitable.”
