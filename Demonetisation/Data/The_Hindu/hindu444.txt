Rajya Sabha passes Disabilities Bill

Both the Houses of Parliament were adjourned for the day following ruckus. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned due to Opposition uproar over controversy involving Union Minister Kiren Rijiju and the Lok Sabha was adjourned by the Speaker following uproar over demonetisation issue.Only three days (including Wednesday) remain for the winter session of Parliament to end and almost no business has been conducted so far. The Income Tax amendment Bill alone was passed in the Lok Sabha as a money Bill, barring which a number of Bills were only tabled and not taken up for discussion.Discussion on demonetisation was listed almost everyday in the Rajya Sabha, only to face disruptions every time the topic was taken up.But this session has been remarkable for four reasons. Here is why.Here are the updates of the day:Rajya Sabha | 2.44 p.m.Congress leader Anand Sharma rises to speak about the allegations against Minister Kiren Rijiju. Deputy Chairman P.J.

I myself have lived with a locomotive disability," says Karan Singh of the Congress. "People should realise that the disabled need to be treated with special courtesy."Naresh Agrawal of the Samajwadi Party says, "Simplify the definition of disabled. It should be easier to attain the certificate. I support the Bill."Nadimul Haque of the Trinamool Congress, "We welcome the number of disabled categories being increased from seven to 21. We support the Bill."C.P. Narayanan of the CPI(M) says, "Though the conditions of the Bill are good, the government seems to have brought in clauses that may curtail the rights of the disabled. That is my fear."Narendra Kumar Swain of the BJD says he supports the Bill. Satish Mishra of the BSP says that the term should be "differently abled" and not "disabled."
