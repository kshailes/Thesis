Congress to launch social media campaign against demonetisation

 A social media campaign exposing the common man’s hardships due to demonetisation exercise has been launched by the Congress.Following a call given by party vice president Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leaders have been asked to fan out across rural India, observe the hardships being faced by peasants, working classes and upload one crore photos and videos. The Congress leadership has provided a WhatsApp number to its cadre.At a State-level party workers meeting here on Friday, AICC leader and MP Bhubaneswar Kalita said that the campaign against the flawed economic policies of the NDA government would intensify as the State and the district units of the Congress would launch mass contact programmes soon.The meeting was attended by party office-bearers from mandal level across the State.“Modi said that the demonetisation exercise will root out corruption, end circulation of fake notes and end cross border terrorism. But it has made bankers more corrupt, it has not stopped violence across the border,” Mr. Kalita said.Karnataka Energy Minister D.K Shivakumar said the Congress would expose the loss of employment, effect on farming and industrial output due to demonetisation and called upon the party cadre to extensively take up people’s issues.Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Raghuveera Reddy said that party cadre should draw strength from increasing vote share in the State and claimed that the Congress is still in reckoning in the State. “Congress will wage a relentless battle to get Special Category Status. Only those leaders who are weak will change their loyalties,” he said. Former MP K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao said that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was more interested in packages than the Special Category Status.
