 The TRS regime is bound to face the ire of the farming community if it failed to stop oppression against the farmhands and address the serious issue of drastic fall in the price of chilli to alleviate the woes of the farmers, Mr. Prabhakar, former Congress MP, said.He was speaking to newsmen along with District Congress Committee president A. Satyam and others at the DCC office here on Friday.Seven of the total ten farmers arrested by the police in connection with the last month’s incident of attack on Khammam market yard belongs to tribal community.A few of them are well-educated and none of them have any criminal antecedents. But they were taken from the district jail to the court in handcuffs for hearing their bail petition on Thursday, he pointed out.“The high-handed act of the police revealed the true colours of the TRS regime and its dictatorial tendencies,” he alleged.“We will approach the National ST Commission seeking action against those responsible for violation of the rights of tribal farmers,” he said.He demanded that the Ministers concerned give an explanation to public over their ‘failure’ to visit the market yard till date and take steps to implement the Centre’s announcement of support price for chilli.
