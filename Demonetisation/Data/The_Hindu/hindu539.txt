Protests against note ban organised across Mysuru 
Various organisations held demonstrations in different parts of the city on Wednesday to criticise demonetization on its first anniversary.It was exactly one year ago on November 8 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Centre’s decision to withdraw high denomination currency notes having face value of ₹500 and ₹1,000.Congress party activists, who observed a ‘Black Day’ on Wednesday, set out on a padayatra from their new office near City Railway Station to the Deputy Commissioner’s office, where a demonstration was organised.In a statement here, the Mysuru City Congress president R. Murthy and Mysuru Rural District Congress president B.J. Vijaykumar said the demonetisation had damaged the economy and plunged the common man into darkness.The Joint Committee of Left parties staged a demonstration in front of the Mahatma Gandhi bust near Law Court Complex in the city.In a statement, the Committee said demonetisation had not only hit the farmers hard, but also led to an increase in prices of essential commodities and decrease in people’s income.Referring to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) estimate that about 99% of the banned notes had been returned, the Committee said demonetisation had not only failed to achieve its objective, but had also slowed down the country’s growth rate.Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) activists too staged a protest in front of the Head Post Office on Irwin Road in the city. “The nation only witnessed economic disaster by demonetisation and the reasons for the move were proved absolutely baseless and absurd,” the SDPI said in a statement here.
