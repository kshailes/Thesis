Story 2 (market) + graphic pointsLAX/Transporters are often paid less freight charges or have to accept supply on credit 
CHENNAI: Many traders who supply vegetables in the city opt to pay in cheque or seek time for full payment as they do not sufficient cash in lower denomination. Lorry owners complain that they are severely affected as they are forced to accept at least partial payment in higher denomination currency notes in the Koyambedu market. Traders, otherwise, sought time to pay later in lower denomination currency. M.Srinivasan, a wedding contractor in Mylapore said “We pay the amount in cheque to the wholesalers or give a few Rs.500, Rs.1,000 notes as part of the payment of produce that we procure. But, we cannot use the same method of payment for vehicles that transport goods. We use the lower denomination notes in our cash reserve to pay at least half the freight charges and seek time for the remaining amount.”Withe the gradual increase in withdrawal limit in the banks, traders hope that the cash transactions will improve and repay credit to transporters.
