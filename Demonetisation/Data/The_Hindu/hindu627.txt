‘Anonymity of cash removed’

With the return of ₹15.28 lakh crore to the formal banking system, almost all cash holdings in the country have lost their anonymity, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in a post on Tuesday, the eve of the anniversary of demonetisation. From this inflow, he said, the amount involving suspicious transactions was estimated to be ₹1.6-1.7 lakh crore. Intended objective“When demonetisation was implemented, one of the intended objectives was to put identity on the cash holdings in the economy,” Mr. Jaitley wrote. “With the return of ₹15.28 lakh crore in the formal banking system, almost entire cash holding of the economy now has an address. It is no more anonymous. From this inflow, the amount involving suspicious transactions based on various estimates ranges from ₹1.6 lakh crore to ₹1.7 lakh crore. Now, it is with the tax administration and other enforcement agencies to use big data analytics and crack down on suspicious transactions.” The Minister said that steps towards this had begun, with the number of Suspicious Transaction Reports filed by banks during 2016-17 increasing almost six times to 3,61,214. He said the number of these reports from financial institutions and intermediaries registered with SEBI witnessed similar growth. “Based on big data analytics, cash seizure by Income Tax Department has more than doubled in 2016-17 when compared to 2015-16; during search and seizure by the Department ₹15,497 crore of undisclosed income has been admitted which is 38% higher than the undisclosed amount admitted during 2015-16; and undisclosed income detected during surveys in 2016-17 is ₹13,716 crore which is 41% higher than the detection made in 2015-16,” he added.Mr. Jaitley said that this process would gain momentum under “Operation Clean Money” introduced on January 31, 2017.“The leads gathered due to data collected during demonetisation period have led to identification of 2.97 lakh suspect shell companies,” he wrote. “After issuance of statutory notices to these companies and following due process under the law, 2.24 lakh companies have been de-registered from the books of Registrar of Companies. Further actions were taken under the law to stop operation of bank accounts of these struck off companies.”The Minister added that of the 2.97 lakh struck off companies, information pertaining to 28,088 companies involving 49,910 bank accounts show that these companies have deposited and withdrawn ₹10,200 crore from November 9, 2016 till the date of strike off from the RoC. He said that many of these companies were found to have more than 100 bank accounts.“110 crore transactions, valued at around ₹3.3 lakh crore and another 240 crore transactions, valued at ₹3.3 lakh crore were carried out through credit cards and debit cards, respectively,” Mr.Jaitley said. “The value of transaction for debit and credit card was ₹1.6 lakh crore and ₹2.4 lakh crore respectively during 2015-16.”
