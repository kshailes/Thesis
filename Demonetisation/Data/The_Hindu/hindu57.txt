Demonetisation a ‘thoughtless act’ of Modi: Rahul

 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, on the note ban anniversary, termed demonetisation as a “tragedy” and a “thoughtless act” and alleged that due to it livelihood of millions of honest Indians were destroyed.He said his party stood with all those people who have suffered due to demonetisation, which was announced on November 8 , 2016 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Taking a poetic dig at the government, he tweeted in Hindi that even a single tear spelt danger for the government and one has not seen an ocean coming out of the eyes, tagging a picture of some poor people crying while standing in queues.“Demonetisation is a tragedy. We stand with millions of honest Indians, whose lives and livelihoods were destroyed by PM’s thoughtless act,” he said on Twitter.“Ek aansu bhi hukumat ke liye khatra hai, tumne dekha nahin aankhon ka samundar hona [Even a single tear is a danger for the government, you have not seen eyes turning into an ocean],” he said in another tweet.To mark the anniversary of note ban, the Congress is observing a “black day” on Wednesday and will hold countrywide protests in the form of processions, rallies and candle-light marches.The Congress, which described the note ban decision as the “biggest scam” and “the largest government-abetted money laundering scheme”, has asked all its State units to organise protests, processions and marches to mark the day.It has also asked all its leaders to participate in such protests and strongly highlight the demerits of the decision, which it said is a “colossal and completely avoidable failure.”The Congress leaders will pan out across the country and will participate in protests with “Desh Bhugat Raha hai” and “India suffers” as the central theme for the day.Mr. Gandhi will lead a candlelight march in Surat’s Chowk Bazar area as part of the Opposition parties’ “Black Day” protest in Gujarat’s Surat.
