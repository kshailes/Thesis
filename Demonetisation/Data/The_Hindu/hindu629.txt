BJP activists observe Anti-Black Money Day

The first anniversary of the Union government’s decision to demonetise ₹1,000 and ₹500 notes was observed as ‘Anti-Black Money Day’ by the Bharatiya Janata Party district unit in the city on Wednesday.The BJP activists gathered at Gopi Circle in large numbers and symbolically burnt an effigy representing black money. Addressing the gathering, S. Rudre Gowda, president of party district unit, said the decision on the note ban was taken by the Centre to eliminate black money. Demonetisation has also helped he Centre detect sources of funds for terrorist activities and counterfeit notes, he said.Hailing the slew of measures taken by the Centre on digital and cashless transactions, he said that cashless transactions would weed out black money and corruption. The rolling out of Goods and Services Tax (GST) was another bold decision taken by the Centre owing to which transactions in black money would come down, he said.Addressing the gathering, R.K. Siddaramanna, former MLC, said the opposition expressed by the Congress to the note ban was politically motivated. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance that used to in power at the Centre for ten years had not taken any measures to eradicate black money, he said.
