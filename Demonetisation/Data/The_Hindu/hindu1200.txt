Some farmers told the Minister that they were yet to get used to the new coupon system and also complained of fall in prices of vegetables. “The problem of small change was addressed with the introduction of the new coupon system. We get the amount encashed against the coupons we get by selling vegetables,” said a woman farmer. However, farmers complained of some glitches at the coupon counter. Harish Rao told the officials to set things right at the earliest. The Minister also told the officials to create awareness among farmers about the coupon system and how to exchange them after the sale.

He said the machines would be supplied by banks.
