People support PM's ‘bold’ demonetisation step, claims Rajnath Singh

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday claimed that people have supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “bold step” of demonetising Rs. 1,000 and old Rs. 500 notes and his fight against black money and corruption.“The Prime Minister’s bold step of demonetisation has been welcomed by the people of the country and we are grateful for that,” Mr. Singh told BJP workers here.The Prime Minister’s fight against black money and corruption was “beyond any doubt” and the people of the country have expressed their gratitude by supporting him despite facing initial difficulties, the Minister said.“People did face initial difficulties after demonetisation was announced, but now they have come down considerably,” he claimed.“People had to wait for hours in queues outside ATMs, but when told they were facing difficulties, many replied, ‘When our jawans our dying on the borders to protect our country against enemies, then why can’t we stand in queues for a few hours.’ This is the spirit of our people,” Mr. Singh said.On November 8, Mr. Modi made the demonetisation announcement.The Home Minister urged party workers to take the BJP government’s achievements to people and ensure that the poor benefited from their work.“The BJP is committed to the development of the poor and the farmers and they must benefit from our schemes. Only then real development will take place in the country,” he said.In Assam too, development would be difficult if the condition of farmers is not improved and “it is a positive thing that the party is in power at the Centre and the State”.“Party workers must realise that the BJP is not here for five years. Ensure we serve people for the next 25 years,” he said.
