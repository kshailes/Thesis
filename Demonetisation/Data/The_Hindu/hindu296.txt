Travails of NRIs in exchanging demonetised notes 
Non-resident Indians (NRIs) visiting India, especially for a short visit, to their native places are finding it difficult to exchange the demonetised currencies of ₹1,000 and ₹500 notes, as these notes can be exchanged only at RBI offices in Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Nagpur.This is also impacting the travel plans of many NRIs especially from Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and many other Northern states who are forced to visit these places to exchange demonetised notes. Moreover, a traveller has to be present in person at these offices with all the travel documents.In a notification issued on December 31, the RBI had said that a facility for exchange of these notes had been made available for resident and non-resident citizens who could not avail the facility from November 10 to December 30, 2016 on account of their absence from India in the period.While this facility will remain open for residents (who were abroad during the specified period) from January 2, 2017 to March 31, 2017, NRIs can avail this till June 30, 2017.However, this facility will be made available through only five of the offices of the RBI at Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Nagpur.While there is no monetary limit for exchange for the eligible Resident Indians, the limit for NRIs will be as per the relevant FEMA Regulations, which allows an NRI to carry only a maximum of ₹25,000 abroad,Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), who are not Indian citizens, are not eligible for this facility.Immigration stampA copy of the passport with immigration stamp as proof of the individual’s absence from the country during the period November 9, 2016 to December 30, 2016 should be submitted. Passport in original also should be presented at the RBI counter for verification.There was about $115 billion in NRI accounts in India. In 2015, a total of US$ 68.91 billion was made in remittances to India from other countries. Around 40% of India's remittances flow to the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh which are among the top international remittance-dependent economies of the world.
