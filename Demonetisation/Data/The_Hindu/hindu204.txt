Demonetisation: A mixed bag for Kannada film industry

Demonetisation has had a mixed impact on the Kannada film industry, which has seen a turnover of ₹400 crore in the one year that has followed. While it helped production houses streamline their transactions through banking channels, it also affected a section of the industry that continues to be largely dependent on dealings in cash.This resulted in a fall in the number of productions. “As many as 141 Kannada and seven Tulu films have been censored till date. Had currency not been demonetised, the number of releases would have crossed 200 by now,” said Umesh Banakar, vice-president, Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC). Industry experts say the situation was grim till the end of December last year. Most of the films released in November and December fared below expectations and there was a considerable dip in footfall. It was single screens that felt the pinch very hard. Things improved in 2017. However, even before the industry could recuperate properly, it took another hit in the form of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.The film industry, which largely depends on cash transactions, was suffocated till the Reserve Bank lifted cash withdrawal limits in March. “Producers had lost the freedom of making payment in cash and production of films resumed only in April, after five months,” said P.H. Basha, producer, distributor and exhibitor. Initially, demonetisation plagued Kannada films as movie buffs were reluctant to visit theatres. However, the situation improved by December 31, said K.V. Chandrashekar, proprietor of Veeresh Theatre. Sources in PVR Cinemas said demonetisation accelerated digital transactions in the film industry and it has become easy for people to books tickets. “This resulted in less manpower and easing of business,” said a manager working for PVR Cinemas.
