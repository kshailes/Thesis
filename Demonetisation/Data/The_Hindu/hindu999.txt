Jayachandra, suspended chief project officer of the State Highway Development Project, in a corruption case registered against him by the Central Bureau of Investigation related to illegal exchange of new currency.Justice Rathnakala passed the order while disposing of the petition filed by Mr. Jayachandra, who was denied bail by the special court for CBI cases.
