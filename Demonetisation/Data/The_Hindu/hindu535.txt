Demonetisation, GST work against economy: Kesineni

In a hard-hitting statement on demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST), Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas said they would trigger a slump in the economy by 4%, and that businessmen failing to service their debts promptly would be viewed as criminals. Speaking at Food Biz, a seminar on food processing sector, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here on Friday, Mr. Srinivas said the global markets were in turmoil and the situation in India was also such that the prospective entrepreneurs need to be extremely cautious before going ahead with their plans. New businesses require at least six years to break-even, and sustenance would be another challenge in the prevailing scenario, he observed.Mr. Srinivas further said the risk taking ability of entrepreneurs was dying due to various reasons, and that unemployment was growing. The entrepreneurs would have many extraneous factors hampering their businesses, which warranted a careful approach to the very idea of setting up a manufacturing plant or grounding some other venture.“Businessmen ought to be pragmatic from the conceptual stage to be able to quickly wriggle out of any crisis. They have to do a lot of homework before taking the plunge,” he added, summing up his views on how businesses could be crippled by a host of issues, including those beyond their control.
