A body blow for migrant workforce 
The large contingent of migrant workforce was among those who were severely hit by the Centre’s demonetisation drive, which forced them to return to their native places in droves. Even after a year, their presence is yet to return to pre-demonetisation days.A recent study conducted by the Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) looked into the reasons why migrants left en masse in the wake of demonetisation.The exercise resulted in a decline in production and overall availability of work, observed the study. “And, migrants were affected the most, as less opportunities resulted in more competition, less negotiation power, and readiness to work for less pay,” the study said.Old currency notesMigrants were forced to accept old currency notes, as many employers found it a convenient way to get rid of black money. Eventually, when currency notes of ₹2,000 were launched to overcome currency deficit, they proved of little help to them, as vendors refused to accept them for want of change.“There were many among migrants without bank accounts. They used to save their wages in cash, and when demonetisation was announced overnight, they could not even deposit money in the bank accounts of others as they used to do in the past, thanks to restrictions imposed in the wake of the exercise,” said Benoy Peter, one of the two who prepared the report.Migrant workers were left with no option but to return to their native places to get old currency notes exchanged there. Besides, their inability to send money resulted in deprivation back home. “Hence, going home and working there for a while was a crisis management strategy for many,” the study said.Several employers and contractors also recommended that migrant workers return home to cut down maintenance expenses. “Migrant workers hardly needed further inducements, as it was not feasible for them to stay back and meet expenses in terms of rent and food with little or no pay,” said Mr. Peter.
