Anil Kumar. As the banks would be accepting the old notes till December 30, the CMC had continued with collecting the old notes.Kandaya Adalat Mr. Anil Kumar, at a press conference in Hassan on Tuesday, said the CMC would hold a Kandaya Adalat on November 22 and 23, to help the public settle their disputes related to taxes. “The council had invited suggestions from the public on improving the services.
